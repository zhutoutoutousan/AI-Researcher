Given a research paper's proposed model name and its paper title, anonymize any mentions of the model name and direct paper self-references in a paragraph.

Replace:
- Model name and variations with "the proposed model" or "the proposed approach"
- Paper self-references with "this paper" or "this study"
- Keep all other content exactly as written

Input:
- Paper Title: {paper_title}
- Model Name: {model_name}
- Paragraph: {paragraph}

Output:
- If no model name mentions found: Return "NO NEED TO PROCESS"
- If anonymization needed: Return the processed paragraph with only required replacements

Note: Only anonymize the specified model name and direct paper references. Keep all other content, including other model names and references, unchanged.
