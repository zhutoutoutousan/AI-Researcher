Write research instructions that captures the research foundations of the given paper by addressing:

1. The primary task or problem domain the research tackles
2. Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work
3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome
4. Key objectives and intended contributions

Focus solely on the motivations and goals while avoiding:
- Specific technical implementation details 
- Names of proposed models or novel components
- Experimental details or results
- Detailed architectural design choices

Present this information in a way that allows other researchers to understand the paper's purpose and research direction without revealing the specific solution approach. Write in clear, straightforward language that highlights the key problems being solved and desired outcomes.

Directly write the instruction without any other words.

Don't mention the specific names of the proposed model, or exact module names that are special to this paper.
