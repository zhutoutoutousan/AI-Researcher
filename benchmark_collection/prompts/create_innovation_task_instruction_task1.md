Analyze the given research paper and write a detailed technical instruction paragraph for researchers to implement its core methodology without reading the full paper. Your instruction must include:

1. What task does the model work on
2. Core techniques/algorithms used in the paper (e.g., specific neural network architectures, optimization methods, data processing approaches)
3. Purpose and function of each major technical component
4. Implementation details for each component, such as:
   - Key parameters and configurations
   - Input/output specifications
   - Important constraints or requirements
5. Step-by-step description of how these components interact and combine into the complete system
6. Critical implementation details that affect performance

(If the examples above do not apply to the input paper, ignore the examples)

Focus only on the technical methodology and implementation aspects. Exclude background information, literature review, and experimental results. Write in a clear, sequential format that a technical researcher could follow to reproduce the core method. 

Directly write the instruction without any other words.

Don't mention the specific names of the proposed model, or exact module names that are special to this paper.
