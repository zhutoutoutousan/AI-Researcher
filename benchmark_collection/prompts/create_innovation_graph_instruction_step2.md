[STEP 2: Context Analysis]
Analyze how each frequently cited paper is discussed:
- Look for influence indicators (e.g., "based on", "extends")
- Assess discussion depth
- Identify methodology-related citations

Output format:
{
    "context_analysis": [
        {
            "reference": "the exact paper title in references",
            "indicators": ["relevant phrases"],
            "depth": "detailed/moderate/brief",
            "is_method": boolean,
            "quotes": ["key contexts"]
        }
    ]
