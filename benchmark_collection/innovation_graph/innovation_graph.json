    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become powerful tools in modeling\ngraph-structured data in recommender systems. However, real-life recommendation\nscenarios usually involve heterogeneous relationships (e.g., social-aware user\ninfluence, knowledge-aware item dependency) which contains fruitful information\nto enhance the user preference learning. In this paper, we study the problem of\nheterogeneous graph-enhanced relational learning for recommendation. Recently,\ncontrastive self-supervised learning has become successful in recommendation.\nIn light of this, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL),\nwhich is able to incorporate heterogeneous relational semantics into the\nuser-item interaction modeling with contrastive learning-enhanced knowledge\ntransfer across different views. However, the influence of heterogeneous side\ninformation on interactions may vary by users and items. To move this idea\nforward, we enhance our heterogeneous graph contrastive learning with meta\nnetworks to allow the personalized knowledge transformer with adaptive\ncontrastive augmentation. The experimental results on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of HGCL over state-of-the-art recommendation\nmethods. Through ablation study, key components in HGCL method are validated to\nbenefit the recommendation performance improvement.

    "task2": "1. The primary task or problem domain the research tackles is the enhancement of recommendation systems through the integration of heterogeneous relational information in user-item interactions. This involves modeling complex user preferences influenced by diverse relationships, such as social connections and knowledge-based item dependencies.\n\n2. Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work include the inadequacy of traditional graph neural networks that focus primarily on homogeneous relationships, which leads to suboptimal representation learning when faced with the rich, heterogeneous data typically present in real-world recommenders. Moreover, these existing methods struggle with data sparsity, as they often require extensive labeled data for effective training and may not generate high-quality user and item embeddings when interactions are insufficient.\n\n3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome include: i) effectively transferring and utilizing the diverse side knowledge from heterogeneous relational views to improve user preference learning; ii) performing heterogeneous relational contrastive learning that adapts to the personalized characteristics of users and items, acknowledging that interactions may be influenced differently across various user-item contexts.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions include the development of a robust framework that employs heterogeneous graph contrastive learning to integrate heterogeneous relationships into recommendation systems. This framework aims to facilitate personalized knowledge transfer using a tailor-made meta network and to enhance data representation through adaptive contrastive learning methods. By addressing these objectives, the researchers intend to significantly improve the recommendation performance and tackle the issues of data sparsity and heterogeneous information incorporation in recommendation tasks."
