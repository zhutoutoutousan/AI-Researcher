However, graph\ntasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making\nthe pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap\nmay even cause a ''negative transfer'' to the specific application, leading to\npoor results. Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing\n(NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging prior\nknowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting topic for graphs with\nthe motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task prompting method for graph\nmodels. Specifically, we first unify the format of graph prompts and language\nprompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this\nway, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph\narea. Then, to further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and\nstate-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we further study the task space of\nvarious graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the\ngraph-level task. Afterward, we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a\nbetter initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting\nframework can be more reliable and general for different tasks.

To implement the core methodology, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Task Definition**: The model facilitates the reformulation of various graph tasks into a unified graph-level format, which helps in bridging the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks.\n\n2. **Core Techniques**:\n   - **Prompt Graph Design**: Create a prompt graph that includes learnable prompt tokens, token structures, and inserting patterns for seamless integration into the original graph.\n   - **Meta-Learning**: Utilize a meta-learning strategy to adaptively learn better prompt initializations across multiple tasks.\n   - **Task Reformulation**: Transform node-level and edge-level tasks into graph-level tasks by creating induced graphs based on a defined neighborhood (e.g., τ-hop neighbors).\n\n3. **Implementation Components**:\n   - **Prompt Tokens**: Initialize a set of learnable prompt tokens, each represented as a vector of the same size as node features. The number of prompt tokens should be significantly less than the number of nodes (|P| ≪ N).\n   - **Token Structure**: Define connections among prompt tokens. You can use tunable parameters or a binary connection based on the dot product between tokens, applying a threshold to prune connections.\n   - **Inserting Patterns**: Implement an inserting function that determines how prompt tokens will be incorporated into the graph. This can be done by adding the prompt tokens to existing node features.\n\n4. **Key Parameters & Configurations**:\n   - **Token Count**: Set the number of prompt tokens (|P|) to a small value (e.g., 10).\n   - **Distance Metric**: For induced graphs, use τ to define the neighborhood size, where τ can be set based on task requirements (e.g., τ = 1 for immediate neighbors).\n   - **Learning Rate**: Use a learning rate (e.g., 0.001) with an Adam optimizer for training.\n\n5. **Input/Output Specifications**:\n   - **Input**: The input will be the original graph G with node features. The prompt graph G_p will be merged with G based on the defined inserting patterns.\n   - **Output**: The output will be the model's predictions for the downstream tasks, which could be node classifications, edge predictions, or graph classifications.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Interaction**:\n   - **Step 1**: Define the original graph G and extract node features.\n   - **Step 2**: Construct the prompt graph G_p by initializing prompt tokens and defining token structures.\n   - **Step 3**: Apply the inserting pattern to merge G_p into G, modifying the node features as per the defined prompt.\n   - **Step 4**: Feed the modified graph into the pre-trained GNN model for processing.\n   - **Step 5**: Utilize meta-learning to adaptively improve prompt tokens based on task-specific data and loss.\n\n7. **Critical Implementation Details**:\n   - Ensure that the initializations of prompt tokens are effective, as poor initialization can hinder performance.\n   - The design of token structures and inserting patterns is crucial; they should be tested and refined to ensure they provide meaningful enhancements to the original graph representation.\n   - Monitor the computational efficiency, as the model should maintain a balance between performance and resource utilization, especially when scaling to larger graphs.\n\nBy following these instructions, researchers can effectively implement the methodology outlined in the paper, improving the adaptability and performance of GNNs across varying graph-related tasks.",

It focuses on the integration of prompting techniques inspired by natural language processing (NLP) to enhance the adaptability of GNNs for various tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and graph-level tasks.\n\n2. Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work:\n   Existing approaches in graph learning often rely on a \"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, which can lead to a significant gap between pre-training tasks and the diverse downstream tasks. Traditional pre-training methods frequently focus on specific task types, such as binary edge prediction, which are not always compatible with the wide range of tasks encountered in practice. This disconnection can result in negative transfer, where the model performs poorly on the target tasks due to misalignment with the pre-training objectives.\n\n3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome:\n   The researchers aim to overcome several challenges: \n   - Bridging the gap between various graph tasks and pre-training strategies to ensure better compatibility and transferability across tasks.\n   - Designing an effective and versatile prompting mechanism that can adapt to the unique structures and demands of graph data, unlike the simpler prompting methods used in NLP.\n   - Developing a robust approach for initializing and learning prompts that can handle the complexities and variabilities inherent in multi-task graph settings.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions:\n   The key objectives of the research are to:\n   - Propose a unified prompting framework for graph tasks that can effectively integrate insights from NLP prompting techniques.\n   - Reformulate node-level and edge-level tasks as graph-level tasks to enhance the generalization and transferability of pre-training knowledge.\n   - Introduce a meta-learning mechanism to learn optimal prompts that can improve performance across multiple tasks.\n   The intended contributions include advancing the understanding of prompt learning in graph contexts, providing a novel framework that enhances the adaptability of GNNs, and demonstrating the efficacy of this approach through extensive evaluations on various graph tasks.",

Towards this\nresearch line, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has exhibited powerful\nperformance in addressing the supervision label shortage issue by learning\naugmented user and item representations. While many of them show their\neffectiveness, two key questions still remain unexplored: i) Most existing\nGCL-based CF models are still limited by ignoring the fact that user-item\ninteraction behaviors are often driven by diverse latent intent factors (e.g.,\nshopping for family party, preferred color or brand of products); ii) Their\nintroduced non-adaptive augmentation techniques are vulnerable to noisy\ninformation, which raises concerns about the model's robustness and the risk of\nincorporating misleading self-supervised signals. In light of these\nlimitations, we propose a Disentangled Contrastive Collaborative Filtering\nframework (DCCF) to realize intent disentanglement with self-supervised\naugmentation in an adaptive fashion. With the learned disentangled\nrepresentations with global context, our DCCF is able to not only distill\nfiner-grained latent factors from the entangled self-supervision signals but\nalso alleviate the augmentation-induced noise. Finally, the cross-view\ncontrastive learning task is introduced to enable adaptive augmentation with\nour parameterized interaction mask generator.

        "abstract": "Rating is a typical user explicit feedback that visually reflects how much a\nuser likes a related item. The (rating) matrix completion is essentially a\nrating prediction process, which is also a significant problem in recommender\nsystems. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in matrix\ncompletion, which captures users' preferences over items by formulating a\nrating matrix as a bipartite graph. However, existing methods are susceptible\ndue to data sparsity and long-tail distribution in real-world scenarios.\nMoreover, the messaging mechanism of GNNs makes it difficult to capture\nhigh-order correlations and constraints between nodes, which are essentially\nuseful in recommendation tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nMulti-Channel Hypergraph Contrastive Learning framework for matrix completion,\nnamed MHCL. Specifically, MHCL adaptively learns hypergraph structures to\ncapture high-order correlations between nodes and jointly captures local and\nglobal collaborative relationships through attention-based cross-view\naggregation. Additionally, to consider the magnitude and order information of\nratings, we treat different rating subgraphs as different channels, encourage\nalignment between adjacent ratings, and further achieve the mutual enhancement\nbetween different ratings through multi-channel cross-rating contrastive\nlearning. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

However, VQ\nmodels are often hindered by the problem of representation collapse in the\nlatent space, which leads to low codebook utilization and limits the\nscalability of the codebook for large-scale training. Existing methods designed\nto mitigate representation collapse typically reduce the dimensionality of\nlatent space at the expense of model capacity, which do not fully resolve the\ncore issue. In this study, we conduct a theoretical analysis of representation\ncollapse in VQ models and identify its primary cause as the disjoint\noptimization of the codebook, where only a small subset of code vectors are\nupdated through gradient descent. To address this issue, we propose\n\\textbf{SimVQ}, a novel method which reparameterizes the code vectors through a\nlinear transformation layer based on a learnable latent basis. This\ntransformation optimizes the \\textit{entire linear space} spanned by the\ncodebook, rather than merely updating \\textit{the code vector} selected by the\nnearest-neighbor search in vanilla VQ models. Although it is commonly\nunderstood that the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to\napplying a single linear layer, our approach works surprisingly well in\nresolving the collapse issue in VQ models with just one linear layer.

Use the selected code vector for reconstruction.\n   - **Step 4**: Reparameterize the selected code vector using the performed linear transformation (C * W), effectively treating both C and W in the optimization process.\n   - **Step 5**: Calculate the loss, which combines reconstruction loss (MSE between original and decoded output) and commitment loss to ensure effective use of the codebook.\n   - **Step 6**: Update only the linear layer (W) through gradient backpropagation, keeping C static throughout this phase to facilitate the joint training procedure.\n\n6. **Critical Implementation Details**:\n   - To prevent representation collapse, it is crucial to carefully set the learning rate so that the transformation matrix W can adapt without compromising the usefulness of the latent space.\n   - Keeping the codebook static during the initial phase speeds up the convergence while ensuring that the linear transformation can stretch and rotate the latent space effectively.\n   - Regularly evaluate the utilization percentage of the codebook during training iterations, aiming for near-complete usage (ideally 100%) to combat representation collapse actively.",
        "task2": "1. The primary task addressed by this research is the problem of representation collapse in vector quantized (VQ) models, which hampers their effectiveness in converting continuous data into discrete representations that fully utilize the available codebook.\n\n2. Existing approaches to combat representation collapse have limitations, such as decreasing the dimensionality of the latent space, which often results in a loss of model capacity and performance. Many of these methods fail to leverage the full potential of larger codebooks, suffering from inadequate utilization rates and thus not solving the underlying issue of representation collapse.\n\n3. The core challenges the researchers aim to overcome include the disjoint optimization procedure of the codebook in VQ models, where only a subset of code vectors gets updated during training, leading to a high percentage of unused codes. This contributes significantly to representation collapse, limiting the proposed model's capability to capture the full diversity of the data being represented.\n\n4. The key objectives of this study include providing a theoretical analysis of representation collapse, proposing a method to improve codebook utilization without compromising model capacity, and showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach across various modalities and tasks. The intended contributions are to facilitate better performance in VQ models by ensuring that all codebook entries are utilized effectively, thus enabling broader applicability in machine learning contexts.",

They operate by maintaining a set of vectors -- often referred to\nas the codebook -- and quantizing each encoder output to the nearest vector in\nthe codebook. However, as vector quantization is non-differentiable, the\ngradient to the encoder flows around the vector quantization layer rather than\nthrough it in a straight-through approximation. This approximation may be\nundesirable as all information from the vector quantization operation is lost.\nIn this work, we propose a way to propagate gradients through the vector\nquantization layer of VQ-VAEs. We smoothly transform each encoder output into\nits corresponding codebook vector via a rotation and rescaling linear\ntransformation that is treated as a constant during backpropagation. As a\nresult, the relative magnitude and angle between encoder output and codebook\nvector becomes encoded into the gradient as it propagates through the vector\nquantization layer and back to the encoder. Across 11 different VQ-VAE training\nparadigms, we find this restructuring improves reconstruction metrics, codebook\nutilization, and quantization error.

The proposed model designed in this paper is designed to improve the performance of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) by addressing issues with gradient propagation through the non-differentiable vector quantization layer.\n\n2. The core methodologies utilized include:\n   - **Rotation and Rescaling Transformation**: A linear transformation that alters the encoder output to align it with the nearest codebook vector without changing the forward pass output.\n   - **Gradient Propagation Method**: The proposed model ensures that gradients flow from the decoder to the encoder while preserving the angle between the gradient and codebook vector.\n   - **Codebook Management**: Utilizes the connection between the encoder output and the corresponding codebook vectors to mitigate codebook collapse and improve utilization.\n\n3. The primary functions of these components are:\n   - The rotation and rescaling transformation modifies how the encoder output is quantized and how information is retained during backpropagation, enabling gradients to reflect the true positioning of the encoder output relative to the codebook vectors.\n   - The gradient propagation method redefines how gradients are transported back to the encoder, allowing for an enhanced and nuanced movement through the quantization layer, which leads to a better performance during training.\n   - Codebook management practices help in maintaining a diverse set of codebook vectors throughout training, avoiding scenarios where multiple vectors become redundant or unused.\n\n4. Implementation details for each component:\n   - **Key Parameters**: \n     - Codebook size should be configured based on the complexity of the dataset (e.g., 1024 or 8192).\n     - Commitment loss coefficient (β) is typically set within [0.25, 2].\n   - **Input/Output Specifications**: \n     - Input to the encoder is a continuous high-dimensional vector, while the output is a corresponding quantized vector from the codebook.\n     - The output for reconstruction is generated using the decoder applied to the transformed codebook vectors.\n   - **Important Constraints**: \n     - Ensure that the codebook is updated correctly with an exponential moving average procedure, and treat both rotation and rescaling during the forward pass as constants with respect to the gradient.\n\n5. Step-by-Step Integration of Components:\n   - **Step 1**: Input the data vector into the encoder to obtain the continuous representation.\n   - **Step 2**: Identify the nearest codebook vector to the encoder output.\n   - **Step 3**: Compute the rotation matrix that aligns the encoder output to the codebook vector.\n   - **Step 4**: Apply the rotation and rescaling transformation to obtain the modified output for the decoder (i.e., `˜ q`).\n   - **Step 5**: Feed `˜ q` into the decoder to produce the reconstructed output.\n   - **Step 6**: Compute the loss using the reconstruction and apply backpropagation.\n   - **Step 7**: During backpropagation, modify the gradient transfer process to maintain the angle using the proposed model, replacing traditional shortcuts in gradient computation.\n\n6. Critical implementation details affecting performance:\n   - The choice of rotation matrix calculation should ensure computational efficiency—using Householder transformations to minimize resource demands.\n   - The deployment of the stop-gradient technique effectively turns off the back-propagation through the quantization layer, which is essential to reflect the intended change without inducing undesired noise in the gradient updates.\n   - Monitor the codebook usage regularly during training to detect any potential collapse early and adjust the training dynamics (e.g., learning rate) accordingly to maintain effective utilization throughout the training period.",

The primary task addressed in this research is enhancing the training and performance of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs) by improving gradient propagation through the non-differentiable vector quantization layer. This focus is essential for minimizing distortion during the conversion of continuous input data into a discrete latent space and subsequently reconstructing it with high fidelity.\n\n2. Existing approaches, particularly those utilizing the Straight-Through Estimator (STE), face significant limitations due to the non-differentiable nature of vector quantization. The STE tends to copy and paste gradients, which can lead to poor performance of the proposed model, including issues like codebook collapse where many codebook entries become inactive and unused. As a result, the information capacity of the latent space is compromised, hindering the reconstructions and overall efficacy of such models.\n\n3. The core challenges the researchers aim to overcome include: (a) effectively propagating gradients through the vector quantization process without losing information, (b) addressing the problem of codebook collapse and promoting higher utilization of codebook vectors, and (c) maintaining high-quality reconstructions while managing the trade-offs between information capacity and quantization error.\n\n4. The key objectives of this study are to introduce an innovative method for gradient propagation that retains more informative updates during backpropagation. The intended contributions include enhancing the utility of the codebook, improving reconstruction metrics, and decreasing quantization errors across various training paradigms while avoiding the pitfalls associated with previous gradient estimation techniques.

Use a function like \\(f(z) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{L}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\tanh(z)\\) to project the data, where \\(L\\) is the number of quantization levels.\n   - **Quantization process**: Round each bounded dimension to its nearest integer to yield the quantized output.\n   - **Loss function**: Operate under a reconstruction loss paradigm typical in VAEs to optimize the proposed model parameters.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**:\n   - **Key Parameters**: \n     - Number of dimensions \\(d\\) and levels \\(L\\) per dimension should be defined based on the codebook size you aim to replicate (e.g., set \\(L_i \\geq 5\\) for all \\(i\\)).\n   - **Input/Output Specifications**: The input to the bounding function will be the output from the final encoder layer; the output after quantization will be in the format \\(\\hat{z}\\), with shape matching the original \\(z\\).\n   - **Constraints**: Ensure all inputs are preprocessed adequately to be within the functioning range of the bounding function.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Integration**:\n   - **Step 1**: Train a standard VAE model and obtain its encoder output \\(z\\).\n   - **Step 2**: Apply the bounding function \\(f\\) on \\(z\\) to limit the output dimensions to usable values.\n   - **Step 3**: Quantize the resultant bounded \\(z\\) using the rounding procedure to generate \\( \\hat{z} \\).\n   - **Step 4**: Use the original \\(z\\) and \\(\\hat{z}\\) in conjunction with the reconstruction loss to backpropagate through the network using the STE for gradient calculation.\n\n6. **Critical Implementation Details**:\n   - Ensure the rounding process is correctly differentiable; utilize the STE to maintain gradient flow during backpropagation.\n   - Maintain high codebook utilization by selecting optimal dimensions and levels based on empirical trials, and monitor performance to refine the parameters if needed.\n   - Adjust the proposed model configurations (number of epochs, batch size) based on the structures laid out in this paper, ensuring hyperparameters match those recommended for the proposed approach integration.\n\nBy following these steps sequentially, researchers can effectively implement the proposed model-based methodology and achieve comparable performance to traditional VQ methods in their applications.",

Since the model is provided with no ground truth information about\nthese sources, inductive biases take a paramount role in enabling\ndisentanglement. In this work, we construct an inductive bias towards encoding\nto and decoding from an organized latent space. Concretely, we do this by (i)\nquantizing the latent space into discrete code vectors with a separate\nlearnable scalar codebook per dimension and (ii) applying strong model\nregularization via an unusually high weight decay. Intuitively, the latent\nspace design forces the encoder to combinatorially construct codes from a small\nnumber of distinct scalar values, which in turn enables the decoder to assign a\nconsistent meaning to each value. Regularization then serves to drive the model\ntowards this parsimonious strategy. We demonstrate the broad applicability of\nthis approach by adding it to both basic data-reconstructing (vanilla\nautoencoder) and latent-reconstructing (InfoGAN) generative models. For\nreliable evaluation, we also propose InfoMEC, a new set of metrics for\ndisentanglement that is cohesively grounded in information theory and fixes\nwell-established shortcomings in previous metrics. Together with\nregularization, latent quantization dramatically improves the modularity and\nexplicitness of learned representations on a representative suite of benchmark\ndatasets. In particular, our quantized-latent autoencoder (QLAE) consistently\noutperforms strong methods from prior work in these key disentanglement\nproperties without compromising data reconstruction.",

The proposed model operates on the task of disentangled representation learning, where the goal is to learn representations that distinctly and independently encode the various underlying sources of variation in a dataset without any ground truth labels.\n\n2. The core techniques used in this paper involve:\n   - **Latent Quantization**: This technique involves quantizing the latent representation into discrete scalar values using separate, learnable codebooks for each dimension.\n   - **Strong Regularization**: Achieved through applying a high weight decay to encourage the proposed approach to utilize a sparse and organized latent space.\n   - **Neural Network Architectures**: A feedforward convolutional encoder and a decoder based on a style-based generator architecture.\n\n3. The purpose and function of each major technical component are:\n   - **Encoder**: Maps input data to a continuous latent space, producing a representation that can later be quantized.\n   - **Latent Quantization**: Converts the continuous latent representations into discrete values based on nearest neighbor assignments to the codebooks, facilitating a structured latent space.\n   - **Decoder**: Reconstructs the data from the quantized latents, learning a mapping from the quantized space back to the original data space.\n   - **Regularization (Weight Decay)**: Encourages the proposed approach to minimize its complexity by penalizing large weights, thus promoting a more parsimonious use of the latent space.\n\n4. Implementation details:\n   - **Key Parameters and Configurations**:\n     - Latent dimensionality (`n_z`): Typically set to twice the number of source variables.\n     - Number of discrete values per codebook (`n_v`): Fixed at 10 in the implementation.\n     - Regularization parameter (weight decay): Should be tuned through a grid search over multiples of 0.001.\n   - **Input/Output Specifications**:\n     - Input to the proposed model is a data point `x` from the dataset, which should be normalized images of size 64x64.\n     - The output is a reconstruction of the input image from the quantized latents, compared using a reconstruction loss.\n   - **Critical Constraints/Requirements**: Ensure that the proposed model can handle continuous inputs and appropriately quantize them into discrete values without losing significant information.\n\n5. Step-by-Step Description of Component Interactions:\n   - Initialize the encoder to map input `x` to a continuous latent `z_c`.\n   - Use the `LatentQuantization` function to quantize `z_c` into discrete values based on the closest entries in the learnable codebooks.\n   - Calculate the quantization loss (`L_quantize`) and the commitment loss (`L_commit`) as part of the training process.\n   - The decoder then takes the quantized latent representation and reconstructs the original data using its internal mapping.\n   - Throughout training, the overall loss combines reconstruction losses and the two quantization losses to optimize the encoder, decoder, and codebooks concurrently.\n\n6. Critical implementation details that affect performance:\n   - The choice of architecture (encoder and decoder design) is essential for enabling effective learning. An expressive architecture, especially for the decoder based on StyleGAN, can significantly influence the interpretability and fidelity of the representations learned.\n   - The use of strong regularization is crucial; too little weight decay may lead to overly complex representations, whereas too much could hinder the learning capacity.\n   - The straight-through gradient estimator is important for ensuring gradients are effectively propagated through the quantization process, thus maintaining the integrity of the network training.\n   - Lastly, the shared codebook design (using separate codebooks for each dimension) ensures more stable optimization and allows for meaningful interpolation between latent states.",

To implement the core methodology, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Architecture**: Implement a neural network to parameterize the velocity field \\( v_{\\theta}(t, x) \\) that maps from noise to data distributions. Use architectures suitable for continuous functions, such as feedforward or convolutional networks. Each layer should have non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Tanh).\n\n2. **Loss Functions**: Utilize two main loss components:\n   - **Velocity Consistency Loss**: This should be structured as:\n     \\[\n     L_{\\theta} = E_{t \\sim U} E_{x_t, x_{t+\\Delta t}} \\| f_{\\theta}(t, x_t) - f_{\\theta}(t+\\Delta t, x_{t+\\Delta t}) \\|^2_2 + \\alpha \\| v_{\\theta}(t, x_t) - v_{\\theta}(t+\\Delta t, x_{t+\\Delta t}) \\|^2_2\n     \\]\n     where \\( f_{\\theta}(t, x_t) = x_t + (1 - t) v_{\\theta}(t, x_t) \\). Choose \\( \\alpha \\) based on cross-validation performance.\n  \n3. **Training Procedure**:\n   - Sample \\( x_0 \\) from the noise distribution \\( p_0 \\).\n   - For multiple time segments, define intervals and compute velocity fields iteratively.\n   - Use the weights of the proposed approach in an exponential moving average to stabilize training.\n\n4. **Sampling Process**:\n   - For single-step or multi-step generation, heuristically sample from the noise distribution and use the learned velocity field as follows: \n   \\[\n   x_{i/k} = x_{(i-1)/k} + \\frac{1}{k} v_{i\\theta}((i-1)/k, x_{(i-1)/k})\n   \\]\n   - Apply the Euler method for iterative updates:\n   \\[\n   x_{t + \\Delta t} = x_t + \\Delta t v_i(t, x_t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( t \\in [i/k, (i + 1)/k - \\Delta t] \\).\n\n5. **Key Implementation Details**:\n   - Ensure the network is equipped with a suitable optimizer such as Adam with a learning rate around \\( 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\).\n   - The batch size should be appropriately set (e.g., 512 for CIFAR-10).\n   - Employ an ODE solver, suggested as Euler's method, during the training and sampling processes.\n   - Maintain a uniform distribution for sampling time intervals \\( U \\).\n\n6. **Performance Considerations**: \n   - Monitor convergence rates and empirically validate parameter configurations through experiments. Start with fewer segments and gradually increase to capture complex distributions better.\n   - Adjust the decay rate for the EMA based on the stability of convergence (commonly around 0.999).\n   - Analyze the trade-offs between sampling efficiency and sample quality, ensuring a balance during proposed model development.\n\nBy following these implementation instructions and maintaining attentiveness to hyperparameter tuning, researchers could replicate the core methodologies of this study effectively.",

Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work:\nPrevious methods, while achieving impressive sample quality, often struggle with an effective trade-off between the quality of generated samples and computational efficiency. This is due to issues such as accumulated errors in iterative rectification methods and high computational costs associated with optimizing complex transport plans in each training batch.\n\n3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome:\nThe researchers aim to eliminate the reliance on iterative processes that can introduce errors, and reduce the complexity and computation associated with optimizing transport plans. They also seek to ensure that the generated flows in the sampling process remain straight and consistent over time, thus avoiding common pitfalls found in existing approaches.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions:\nThe main objectives are to propose a new method, the proposed model, which enforces self-consistency in the velocity field of the flows, thereby allowing for the definition of straight flows more effectively. Additionally, the work aims to enhance model expressiveness through a multi-segment training approach. The intended contributions include theoretical foundations for the proposed method, along with practical improvements that result in faster training convergence and better sample quality compared to existing flow matching and consistency models.

Additionally, it incorporates quantization to reduce the computational overhead associated with high-dimensional data during the assignment step.\n\n3. **Major Technical Components**:\n   - **Batch-wise Linear Assignment**: Matches noise and image batches to minimize the total distance, facilitating efficient training by keeping image-noise mappings distinguishable.\n   - **Quantization**: Reduces the precision of input representations to lower 32-bit floating point formats (to 16-bit), without compromising the overall Gaussian distribution of noise.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**:\n   - **Batch-wise Linear Assignment**:\n     - **Key Parameters**: Use L2 distance as the metric for assignment.\n     - **Input Specifications**: \n       - `x_b`: Batch of images.\n       - `n_rand_b`: Batch of random noise.\n       - `t_b`: Sampled diffusion steps.\n       - `α`: Diffusion schedule.\n     - **Output Specification**: The output is the batch of diffused images, `x_t,b`.\n     - **Constraints/Requirements**: Requires compatible dimensions between image and noise batches for proper assignment.\n\n   - **Quantization**:\n     - Apply quantization to reduce data size before performing assignments to ensure efficiency in memory usage.\n     - Ensure that the quantization does not interfere with the network's ability to learn from the assigned noise.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Description**:\n   1. Prepare a batch of images and a corresponding batch of random Gaussian noise.\n   2. Convert the image and noise data to a lower precision (fp16).\n   3. Compute the pairwise L2 distances between the image and noise batches.\n   4. Execute the linear assignment using an optimization function (e.g., from SciPy) to obtain the optimal pairing of images to noise.\n   5. Using the assignment matrix, modify the input noise according to the matches derived in the assignment step.\n   6. Pass the reassigned noise to the diffusion process to generate the output images.\n   7. Optionally, repeat the process for multiple training iterations or modify the input data accordingly.\n\n6. **Critical Implementation Details**: \n   - Ensure that the image and noise assignment can run efficiently with large batch sizes; this study benchmarks a high batch size (e.g., 1024) and notes that the assignment operation takes about 22.8 ms. Utilizing quantization significantly impacts training speed by reducing memory and computational requirements.\n   - Monitor the performance of the proposed model during training to validate that the mapping retains a Gaussian distribution while improving the quality of generated images through the assignment of nearby noise points.\n\nFollowing these steps will allow researchers to implement the core methodology of the proposed approach effectively.",

This paper emphasizes improving the speed and effectiveness of the training process, which currently remains a significant bottleneck in the iterative development of diffusion-based generative AI.\n\n2. Current limitations in existing approaches include the suboptimal noise-data mapping during training, where each image is diffused across the entire noise space. This results in a mixture of images at every point in the noise layer, complicating the optimization of the denoising function and leading to slow convergence rates that require extensive computational resources.\n\n3. The core challenges the researchers aim to overcome are the inefficiencies associated with the training of diffusion models due to the miscibility issue in noisy diffusion steps. This study seeks to address how to make the mixing of image data and noise more distinguishable to facilitate better optimization during the denoising process.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions involve proposing a novel training strategy inspired by the proposed model from physics. This method aims to minimize the image-noise pair distance within mini-batches, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness of data mappings. By doing so, the researchers intend to significantly progress the speed of training for various diffusion models across datasets and tasks while improving overall image quality, all while maintaining a simple implementation that only necessitates minimal adjustments in the training code.",

Resample with fewer steps (approximately 100) during inference.\n\n   - **Loss Function (Diffusion Loss)**:\n     - Implement the diffusion loss as formulated in this paper: compute noise predictions, and apply L2 loss to the difference between predicted and actual noise.\n\n5. **Interaction of Components**:\n   - First, collect a sequence of continuous-valued image tokens. Input these to the autoregressive model (such as a Transformer) to produce the conditioning vectors (z).\n   - Pass the tokens through the diffusion model to generate noise-corrupted examples, and utilize the MLP to predict the noise.\n   - Use the computed loss to optimize both the autoregressive network and the denoising MLP by backpropagating the gradients through the diffusion loss function.\n\n6. **Critical Implementation Details**:\n   - Ensure that sampling is done using a reverse diffusion approach, starting from a Gaussian distribution for generating tokens.\n   - Implement temperature scaling when sampling tokens to control sample diversity and incorporate it during the noise prediction.\n   - Pay careful attention to input/output specifications: ensure all inputs maintain their continuous representation and that the conditioning for the denoising network aligns correctly with the diffusion process.\n\nBy adhering to these steps and configurations, you can successfully reproduce the core methodology outlined in this study while leveraging continuous-valued representations for autoregressive image generation.",

        "abstract": "In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs),\nprior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as\nfew-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, while\neffective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes\na novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Our\nfindings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from\npre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \\textit{decoding} process. Rather than\nconventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens,\nuncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This\napproach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to\nassess the LLMs' \\textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe\nthat the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher\nconfidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively\ndifferentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies on\nvarious reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding effectively\nelicits reasoning capabilities from language models, which were previously\nobscured by standard greedy decoding.",

This methodology automates the generation of relevant exemplars, allowing LLMs to self-generate pertinent knowledge before solving a given problem, thus enhancing their reasoning capabilities.\n\nTo implement this approach, follow these key steps:\n\n1. **Task Specification**: Define the specific problem that the LLM needs to address, such as math problem solving, code generation, or logical reasoning.\n\n2. **Prompt Construction**: Create a structured input prompt for the LLM that includes:\n   - **Problem Statement**: Clearly state the problem you want the proposed model to solve.\n   - **Exemplar Generation Instruction**: Include instructions to prompt the proposed model to recall and generate diverse exemplars.\n     - For example: “# Problem: [insert problem] # Relevant Problems: Recall three relevant and distinct problems, describe each, and explain their solutions.”\n   - **Knowledge Generation Instruction** (optional but recommended for complex tasks): Ask for high-level knowledge relevant to the problem. For example, “# Provide a tutorial: Identify core concepts in the problem and provide a tutorial.”\n   - **Solution Instruction**: Instruct the proposed model to solve the original problem after generating exemplars. Example: “# Solve the initial problem: [insert problem]”.\n\n3. **Parameter Configuration**:\n   - Set the number of exemplars to be generated. Empirical observations show that **K = 3 to 5** exemplars yield the best performance.\n   - Consider the **temperature setting** for the proposed model's generation to control randomness (suggested temperature of around **0.7**).\n\n4. **Input/Output Specifications**:\n   - Input: A well-structured prompt as detailed above.\n   - Output: The generated exemplars and the solution to the original problem, formatted as the proposed model outputs the rationale, followed by the final answer (e.g., “The answer is \\boxed{x}”).\n\n5. **Interaction of Components**:\n   - The proposed model first analyzes the input problem and generates relevant exemplars based on the provided instructions, ensuring they are distinct and contextually appropriate.\n   - Once the exemplars are generated, the proposed model can leverage these examples to refer back to relevant information while solving the original problem.\n   - Align the generation of knowledge with exemplars to enhance the accuracy of the final output.\n\n6. **Performance Considerations**:\n   - Monitor the **quality of generated exemplars** to ensure they are both relevant and distinct.\n   - The **prompting strategy** must encourage diversity in generated examples, as repeated patterns can mislead problem-solving.\n   - Be aware of the LLM's capacity; stronger models perform better with the proposed approach than weaker models.\n\nBy implementing these steps, researchers can replicate the reasoning capabilities of large language models as proposed in this study, enhancing their performance on complex reasoning tasks without the need for manually curated labeled exemplars.",

Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome include the difficulty of automatically generating tailored and relevant reasoning exemplars without manual labeling, as well as ensuring that the generated guidance effectively aids LLMs in tackling intricate tasks such as mathematical problem solving and code generation.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions include developing a new prompting mechanism—the proposed model—that enables LLMs to autonomously create relevant knowledge and exemplars in the context of the problem at hand, enhancing both the adaptability and performance of LLMs on various reasoning-intensive tasks while eliminating the need for manual labeling of examples.",

However, LLMs can still struggle with problems that are\neasy for humans, such as generating action plans for executing tasks in a given\nenvironment, or performing complex math, logical, and commonsense reasoning.\nThe deficiency stems from the key fact that LLMs lack an internal\n$\\textit{world model}$ to predict the world $\\textit{state}$ (e.g., environment\nstatus, intermediate variable values) and simulate long-term outcomes of\nactions. This prevents LLMs from performing deliberate planning akin to human\nbrains, which involves exploring alternative reasoning paths, anticipating\nfuture states and rewards, and iteratively refining existing reasoning steps.\nTo overcome the limitations, we propose a new LLM reasoning framework,\n$\\underline{R}$easoning vi$\\underline{a}$ $\\underline{P}$lanning\n$\\textbf{(RAP)}$. RAP repurposes the LLM as both a world model and a reasoning\nagent, and incorporates a principled planning algorithm (based on Monto Carlo\nTree Search) for strategic exploration in the vast reasoning space. During\nreasoning, the LLM (as agent) incrementally builds a reasoning tree under the\nguidance of the LLM (as world model) and task-specific rewards, and obtains a\nhigh-reward reasoning path efficiently with a proper balance between\nexploration $\\textit{vs.}$ exploitation. We apply RAP to a variety of\nchallenging reasoning problems including plan generation, math reasoning, and\nlogical inference. Empirical results on these tasks demonstrate the superiority\nof RAP over various strong baselines, including CoT and least-to-most prompting\nwith self-consistency. RAP on LLAMA-33B surpasses CoT on GPT-4 with 33%\nrelative improvement in a plan generation setting.",

The proposed model is designed for reasoning tasks including generating action plans in environments (e.g., Blocksworld problem), performing mathematical reasoning, and executing logical inference.\n\n2. The core techniques used in this paper include:\n   - A large language model (LLM) configured as both the world model and reasoning agent.\n   - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for strategic exploration of reasoning paths.\n   - A reward function framework that incorporates various metrics (likelihood of actions, confidence of state predictions, self-evaluation of reasoning steps).\n\n3. Each major technical component serves specific purposes:\n   - The LLM as the world model predicts future states based on current states and actions.\n   - The LLM as the reasoning agent generates actions leading to the next state and builds a reasoning tree.\n   - MCTS explores the potential reasoning paths, balancing exploration with exploitation to prioritize promising actions.\n   - The reward function evaluates the desirability of reasoning steps to guide the exploration effectively.\n\n4. Implementation details for each component:\n   - **LLM as World Model**: Initialize with a natural language prompt that describes the expected behavior (e.g., state transition). The prompt should provide context for the task (e.g., \"Given the current state A and action B, predict the next state\"). Outputs are states represented in natural language.\n   - **LLM as Reasoning Agent**: Use a similar prompting approach to generate actions based on the current state. Actions are defined in the context of the problem domain (e.g., for Blocksworld, specific actions like \"pick up,\" \"stack\").\n   - **MCTS**: Use the LLM to sample a fixed number of potential actions (`d`) at each node, and maintain a state-action value function `Q` that estimates future rewards based on previous iterations. The maximum depth of exploration should be defined (e.g., limit on number of iterations).\n   - **Reward Function**: Use a combination of several reward measures:\n     - The log probability of chosen actions (action likelihood).\n     - Confidence measures based on multiple samples/answers to assess state predictions.\n     - Self-assessment by the LLM to evaluate the correctness of reasoning steps.\n\n5. Step-by-step interaction and combination:\n   - Initialize the LLM both as a world model and as a reasoning agent using specific prompts relevant to the task domain.\n   - Begin with the initial state and generate potential actions through sampling from the LLM.\n   - Execute the selected action, transitioning to a new state as predicted by the world model.\n   - Implement MCTS, selecting actions and expanding the reasoning tree iteratively, capturing states and actions at each node.\n   - After a predetermined number of iterations or reaching terminal states, backpropagate the rewards to update the value function for the entire path.\n   - Use the reward outputs to guide the exploration in future iterations.\n\n6. Critical implementation details affecting performance:\n   - The number of MCTS iterations should be carefully tuned. Insufficient iterations can lead to incomplete exploration, while excessive iterations may lead to computational inefficiencies.\n   - The choice of prompts significantly impacts the proposed model's ability to generate appropriate actions and state predictions; this requires careful crafting to align with the problem's context.\n   - The balance between the different reward metrics should be optimized based on empirical results for the specific reasoning task at hand, as different tasks may yield varying sensitivities to the choice of rewards.",

Specifically, it focuses on enhancing the ability of LMs to tackle complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, creative writing, and crossword puzzles by enabling a more structured and deliberate approach to problem-solving.\n\n2. Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work:  \n   Existing approaches, such as standard autoregressive token generation and chain-of-thought prompting, tend to rely on simple, sequential decision-making processes that do not allow for exploration of different reasoning paths or for the evaluation of intermediate steps. These methods can struggle with tasks that necessitate lookahead capabilities, backtracking, and a consideration of multiple possible solutions, thus exhibiting shortcomings in handling combinatorial search problems effectively.\n\n3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome:  \n   The research seeks to overcome two primary challenges: (1) the inability of LMs to actively explore various reasoning branches within the problem-solving process, and (2) the lack of a mechanism for evaluating different solution paths through strategic planning, lookahead, and backtracking. The goal is to empower LMs to engage in a more sophisticated reasoning process akin to human cognitive strategies in problem-solving.\n\n4.

However, the growth of the\nreasoning chain introduces uncertainty and error accumulation, making it\nchallenging to elicit accurate final results. To tackle this challenge of\nuncertainty in multi-step reasoning, we introduce a stepwise self-evaluation\nmechanism to guide and calibrate the reasoning process of LLMs. We propose a\ndecoding algorithm integrating the self-evaluation guidance via stochastic beam\nsearch. The self-evaluation guidance serves as a better-calibrated automatic\ncriterion, facilitating an efficient search in the reasoning space and\nresulting in superior prediction quality. Stochastic beam search balances\nexploitation and exploration of the search space with temperature-controlled\nrandomness. Our approach surpasses the corresponding Codex-backboned baselines\nin few-shot accuracy by $6.34\\%$, $9.56\\%$, and $5.46\\%$ on the GSM8K, AQuA,\nand StrategyQA benchmarks, respectively. Experiment results with Llama-2 on\narithmetic reasoning demonstrate the efficiency of our method in outperforming\nthe baseline methods with comparable computational budgets.

Despite the significant influence of categorical features such as brand, category, and price bucket on the user decision-making process, there are not many studies dedicated to understanding the GNN's capability to extract and model such preferences effectively. The study extensively compares and tests various techniques for incorporating categorical features into the GNN framework to address this gap. These techniques include one-hot encoding-based node features, category-value nodes, and hyperedges. Three real-world datasets are used to answer what is the most optimal way to incorporate such information. In addition, the paper introduces a novel hyperedge-based method designed to leverage categorical features more effectively compared to existing approaches. The advantage of the hyperedge approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments in effectively modeling categorical features and extracting user attribute-specific preferences.",

Although various propagation mechanisms and graph filters were proposed, few works have considered the convergence and stability of graph filters under infinite-depth scenarios. To address this problem, we elucidate the criterion for the graph filter formed by power series and further establish a scalable regularized learning principle, which can guide us on how to design infinite deep GNN. Following the framework, we develop Adaptive Power GNN (APGNN), a deep GNN that employs exponentially decaying weights to aggregate graph information of different orders so as to mine the deeper neighbor information. Different from existing GNNs, APGNN can be seamlessly extended to an infinite-depth network. Moreover, we analyze the generalization of the proposed learning framework via uniform convergence and present its upper bound in theory. Experimental results show that APGNN obtains superior performance against the state-of-the-art GNNs.",

Unlike traditional\ncontinuous GNNs that rely on integer-order differential equations, FROND\nemploys the Caputo fractional derivative to leverage the non-local properties\nof fractional calculus. This approach enables the capture of long-term\ndependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms\nin conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in\ngraph representation learning. We offer an interpretation of the node feature\nupdating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the\nfeature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process. We\ndemonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting.\nExperimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional\nadaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating\ntheir consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's\npotential as an effective extension to enhance traditional continuous GNNs.

The proposed model addresses the task of graph representation learning, specifically aiming to enhance node classification and mitigate oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) using a fractional-order differential equation approach.\n\n2. The core techniques utilized in this methodology are:\n   - **Caputo Fractional Derivative**: A generalization of traditional derivatives that captures memory effects by considering the entire history of the feature updates.\n   - **Dynamic Operator F**: A function that describes how node features evolve over the graph, akin to standard GNN operations such as message passing.\n   - **Predictor-Corrector Numerical Methods**: Employed for time discretization in solving the fractional differential equations numerically.\n\n3. The function of each major technical component:\n   - **Caputo Fractional Derivative**: Allows for a non-local feature update mechanism that incorporates previous states, enhancing representation learning.\n   - **Dynamic Operator F**: Defines the information propagation process across the graph, determining how features are updated at each time step.\n   - **Numerical Solvers**: These methods ensure the effective computation of the fractional derivatives while preserving the framework's memory-dependent dynamics.\n\n4. Implementation details for each component include:\n   - **Caputo Fractional Derivative**: Set β to a suitable value (0 < β ≤ 1) based on the graph's characteristics. The initial condition is X[⌈β⌉-1](0) = X, where X is the feature matrix.\n   - **Dynamic Operator F**: Depending on the proposed model variant (e.g., inspired by GRAND or based on attention mechanisms), define F(W, X(t)) using learnable parameters.\n   - **Hyperparameters**: Optimize β through hyperparameter tuning. The time parameter T for discretization should be set based on computational resources (larger T may require short memory approaches).\n   - **Input/Output Specifications**: Input consists of node features and graph structure; output is a refined node representation after T time steps.\n\n5. The step-by-step operation of how these components interact:\n   - Start with the initial node feature matrix X(0).\n   - Utilize the specified Caputo fractional derivative to set up the feature evolution as described in the fractional differential equation DβtX(t) = F(W, X(t)), which relates the current state to the prior states by acknowledging the history.\n   - Apply the numerical solver (basic predictor or predictor-corrector) to iteratively update the node features' values over discretized time steps (from 0 to T).\n   - Finally, decode the updated features through a learnable decoder to achieve the final node embeddings.\n\n6. Critical implementation details affecting performance:\n   - The choice of β plays a crucial role; smaller values generally enhance memory effects but may require more iterations to achieve convergence.\n   - The efficiency of numerical solvers directly impacts runtime and approximation accuracy, especially for larger datasets; thus, employing advanced techniques, such as using the short memory principle, can significantly improve computational efficiency.\n   - Ensuring appropriate conditions for the initial values and tuning the hyperparameters based on datasets will help achieve optimal performance and mitigate issues such as oversmoothing or convergence stagnation.",

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs), as the de-facto model class for representation learning on graphs, are built upon the multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) architecture with additional message passing layers to allow features to flow across nodes. While conventional wisdom commonly attributes the success of GNNs to their advanced expressivity, we conjecture that this is not the main cause of GNNs' superiority in node-level prediction tasks. This paper pinpoints the major source of GNNs' performance gain to their intrinsic generalization capability, by introducing an intermediate model class dubbed as P(ropagational)MLP, which is identical to standard MLP in training, but then adopts GNN's architecture in testing. Intriguingly, we observe that PMLPs consistently perform on par with (or even exceed) their GNN counterparts, while being much more efficient in training. This finding sheds new insights into understanding the learning behavior of GNNs, and can be used as an analytic tool for dissecting various GNN-related research problems. As an initial step to analyze the inherent generalizability of GNNs, we show the essential difference between MLP and PMLP at infinite-width limit lies in the NTK feature map in the post-training stage. Moreover, by examining their extrapolation behavior, we find that though many GNNs and their PMLP counterparts cannot extrapolate non-linear functions for extremely out-of-distribution samples, they have greater potential to generalize to testing samples near the training data range as natural advantages of GNN architectures.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has achieved significantly superior performance in self-supervised graph representation learning. However, the existing GCL technique has inherent smooth characteristics because of its low-pass GNN encoder and objective based on homophily assumption, which poses a challenge when applying it to heterophilic graphs. In supervised learning tasks, spectral GNNs with polynomial approximation excel in both homophilic and heterophilic settings by adaptively fitting graph filters of arbitrary shapes. Yet, their applications in unsupervised learning are rarely explored. Based on the above analysis, a natural question arises: Can we incorporate the excellent properties of spectral polynomial filters into graph contrastive learning? In this paper, we address the question by studying the necessity of introducing high-pass information for heterophily from a spectral perspective. We propose PolyGCL, a GCL pipeline that utilizes polynomial filters to achieve contrastive learning between the low-pass and high-pass views. Specifically, PolyGCL utilizes polynomials with learnable filter functions to generate different spectral views and an objective that incorporates high-pass information through a linear combination. We theoretically prove that PolyGCL outperforms previous GCL paradigms when applied to graphs with varying levels of homophily. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which demonstrate the promising performance of PolyGCL on homophilic and heterophilic graphs.",

        "task2": "1. The primary task or problem domain the research tackles:\nThe research addresses the challenge of self-supervised graph representation learning, specifically focusing on Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) within the context of heterophilic graphs—graphs where connected nodes may represent different classes or labels.\n\n2. Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work:\nExisting GCL techniques largely rely on the homophily assumption, which posits that connected nodes in a graph typically share similar representations. Consequently, current methods, which often utilize low-pass filters, tend to underperform on heterophilic graphs due to their inability to effectively capture high-frequency information that distinguishes between differing node classes. This limitation results in a lack of effective self-supervised learning approaches for graphs with varying levels of homophily and heterophily.\n\n3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome:\nThe researchers aim to overcome the challenges posed by the inherent smoothness of traditional GCL methods when applied to heterophilic graphs. They specifically target the need for a framework that can leverage the advantages of spectral polynomial filters to introduce high-pass information, thereby enhancing representation learning for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. The challenge lies in effectively integrating high-frequency information without the need for complex data augmentations or preprocessing.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions:\nThe key objectives of the research include developing a new GCL framework that incorporates the properties of spectral polynomial filters, which can adaptively capture both low-pass and high-pass spectral views of graph data. The intended contributions are to theoretically demonstrate the necessity of high-pass information for heterophilic settings, to establish a learning objective that optimally combines low-pass and high-pass views, and to show through extensive experiments that the proposed approach achieves superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs compared to existing paradigms.",

To this end, we introduce an energy constrained diffusion model which encodes a batch of instances from a dataset into evolutionary states that progressively incorporate other instances' information by their interactions. The diffusion process is constrained by descent criteria w.r.t.~a principled energy function that characterizes the global consistency of instance representations over latent structures. We provide rigorous theory that implies closed-form optimal estimates for the pairwise diffusion strength among arbitrary instance pairs, which gives rise to a new class of neural encoders, dubbed as DIFFormer (diffusion-based Transformers), with two instantiations: a simple version with linear complexity for prohibitive instance numbers, and an advanced version for learning complex structures. Experiments highlight the wide applicability of our model as a general-purpose encoder backbone with superior performance in various tasks, such as node classification on large graphs, semi-supervised image/text classification, and spatial-temporal dynamics prediction.",

        "abstract": "Graph neural networks have been extensively studied for learning with\ninter-connected data. Despite this, recent evidence has revealed GNNs'\ndeficiencies related to over-squashing, heterophily, handling long-range\ndependencies, edge incompleteness and particularly, the absence of graphs\naltogether. While a plausible solution is to learn new adaptive topology for\nmessage passing, issues concerning quadratic complexity hinder simultaneous\nguarantees for scalability and precision in large networks. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel all-pair message passing scheme for efficiently propagating\nnode signals between arbitrary nodes, as an important building block for a\npioneering Transformer-style network for node classification on large graphs,\ndubbed as \\textsc{NodeFormer}. Specifically, the efficient computation is\nenabled by a kernerlized Gumbel-Softmax operator that reduces the algorithmic\ncomplexity to linearity w.r.t. node numbers for learning latent graph\nstructures from large, potentially fully-connected graphs in a differentiable\nmanner. We also provide accompanying theory as justification for our design.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the promising efficacy of the method in\nvarious tasks including node classification on graphs (with up to 2M nodes) and\ngraph-enhanced applications (e.g., image classification) where input graphs are\nmissing.",

        "task1": "1. The proposed model focuses on the task of node classification in large graphs, addressing challenges like scalability, heterophily, long-range dependencies, and the absence of edges.\n\n2. The core techniques used in this study include a kernelized Gumbel-Softmax operator for all-pair message passing, which reduces computational complexity to linear (O(N)), and a Transformer-style network architecture designed for layer-wise learning of latent graph structures.\n\n3. The purpose of the kernelized Gumbel-Softmax operator is to enable differentiable learning of discrete graph structures by approximating categorical distributions. The Transformer-style architecture facilitates information propagation between arbitrary pairs of nodes through learned latent graphs.\n\n4. Implementation details for each component:\n   - **Kernelized Gumbel-Softmax Operator**: Set the temperature parameter (τ) to a range typically between 0.25 and 0.4 for training. It operates on node feature representations (D-dimensional feature vectors). The output of this operator is a distribution over node connections, facilitating the selection of neighbors for message passing.\n   - **Node Feature Input**: Each node input should be represented as a feature vector (e.g., {x_u} ∈ R^D), and the output is an updated representation of the node embedding after message passing.\n   - **Relational Bias (if applicable)**: Introduces activation (e.g., sigmoid) to adjust the message passing weights based on an observed adjacency matrix, which enhances weight assignment for connected nodes.\n   - **Edge Regularization Loss**: Combines categorical edge probabilities with a supervised classification loss, encouraging the network to maintain predicted edges consistent with observed edges.\n\n5. The step-by-step interaction of these components includes:\n   - Begin with an input matrix of node embeddings (X) and, if available, an adjacency matrix (A).\n   - Apply the kernelized Gumbel-Softmax operator to the embedding matrix to generate a probability distribution over neighbor selection for each node.\n   - Use these probabilities to sample neighbors, allowing for message passing where each node aggregates information from its selected neighbors.\n   - Update the node embeddings using an attention mechanism, which can be enhanced by relational bias if edges are available.\n   - After K iterations of neighbor sampling, apply loss functions comprising a supervised classification loss and, if applicable, edge-level regularization loss to optimize the embedding representations.\n\n6. Critical implementation details affecting performance involve:\n   - Careful tuning of the temperature parameter (τ) in the Gumbel-Softmax operator, as it significantly influences the proposed approach's capacity to capture the discrete nature of graph structures.\n   - Utilizing appropriate batch sizes for large-scale graphs, ensuring enough memory is available while also maintaining computational efficiency.\n   - Choosing the correct dimensionality for random features in the kernel approximation, balancing model expressiveness and training stability.\n   - The use of dropout or other regularization techniques such as edge-level regularization can influence the proposed model's generalization capabilities on unseen data.",
        "task2": "1. The primary task or problem domain the research tackles:\nThe research addresses the challenge of node classification in large graphs, focusing on the efficiency of graph structure learning and message passing techniques within those graphs.\n\n2. Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work:\nExisting methods, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), face difficulties related to over-squashing, handling heterophily, managing long-range dependencies, and dealing with incomplete graphs. Furthermore, the quadratic complexity associated with learning new graph structures significantly limits scalability for graphs with millions of nodes.\n\n3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome:\nThe researchers aim to overcome severe scalability issues inherent in existing node classification methods, while also ensuring that these methods are capable of learning effective representations of node relationships in diverse and potentially incomplete graph structures.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions:\nThe key objectives include developing a scalable algorithm that maintains linear complexity for learning graph structures, enabling efficient message passing across arbitrary node pairs. The intended contributions also focus on creating a new class of graph networks that do not require fully specified input graphs, while improving performance in node-level prediction tasks and addressing the aforementioned limitations of existing GNN methods. This study presents the proposed model to enhance these capabilities.",
