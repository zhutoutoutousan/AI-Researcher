answer: 'To determine the real values of \( x \) that are not in the domain of the
  function

  \[

  f(x) = \frac{1}{|x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|},

  \]

  we need to find where the denominator is zero, since division by zero is undefined.


  ### Step 1: Analyze the denominator

  The denominator is:

  \[

  |x^2 + 3x - 4| + |x^2 + 9x + 20|.

  \]

  For the denominator to be zero, both absolute value terms must simultaneously be
  zero:

  \[

  |x^2 + 3x - 4| = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad |x^2 + 9x + 20| = 0.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Solve \( |x^2 + 3x - 4| = 0 \)

  The equation \( |x^2 + 3x - 4| = 0 \) implies:

  \[

  x^2 + 3x - 4 = 0.

  \]

  Solving this quadratic equation:

  \[

  x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{2} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{2}.

  \]

  Thus, the solutions are:

  \[

  x = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -4.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Solve \( |x^2 + 9x + 20| = 0 \)

  The equation \( |x^2 + 9x + 20| = 0 \) implies:

  \[

  x^2 + 9x + 20 = 0.

  \]

  Solving this quadratic equation:

  \[

  x = \frac{-9 \pm \sqrt{81 - 80}}{2} = \frac{-9 \pm 1}{2}.

  \]

  Thus, the solutions are:

  \[

  x = -4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -5.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Find the intersection of solutions

  For the denominator to be zero, both conditions must hold simultaneously. The only
  common solution is:

  \[

  x = -4.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Conclusion

  The value \( x = -4 \) makes the denominator zero, so it is not in the domain of
  \( f(x) \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(-4\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
