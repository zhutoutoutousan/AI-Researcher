answer: 'To solve the equation \( |5x - 1| = x + 3 \), we consider the two cases for
  the absolute value:


  ### Case 1: \( 5x - 1 \geq 0 \)

  If \( 5x - 1 \geq 0 \), then \( |5x - 1| = 5x - 1 \). The equation becomes:

  \[

  5x - 1 = x + 3

  \]

  Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

  \[

  4x - 1 = 3

  \]

  Add \( 1 \) to both sides:

  \[

  4x = 4

  \]

  Divide by \( 4 \):

  \[

  x = 1

  \]

  We check if this solution satisfies \( 5x - 1 \geq 0 \):

  \[

  5(1) - 1 = 4 \geq 0

  \]

  So \( x = 1 \) is valid.


  ### Case 2: \( 5x - 1 < 0 \)

  If \( 5x - 1 < 0 \), then \( |5x - 1| = -(5x - 1) = -5x + 1 \). The equation becomes:

  \[

  -5x + 1 = x + 3

  \]

  Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

  \[

  -6x + 1 = 3

  \]

  Subtract \( 1 \) from both sides:

  \[

  -6x = 2

  \]

  Divide by \( -6 \):

  \[

  x = -\frac{1}{3}

  \]

  We check if this solution satisfies \( 5x - 1 < 0 \):

  \[

  5\left(-\frac{1}{3}\right) - 1 = -\frac{5}{3} - 1 = -\frac{8}{3} < 0

  \]

  So \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \) is valid.


  ### Conclusion

  The solutions are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{3} \). The largest value of \(
  x \) that satisfies the equation is \( 1 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
