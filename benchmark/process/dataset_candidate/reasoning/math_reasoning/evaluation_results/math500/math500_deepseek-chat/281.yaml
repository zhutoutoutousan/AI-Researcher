answer: "To determine the measure of angle \\( A \\) in the star formed by extending\
  \ the sides of a regular pentagon, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand\
  \ the properties of a regular pentagon:**\n   - A regular pentagon has five equal\
  \ sides and five equal angles.\n   - Each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures\
  \ \\( 108^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Analyze the star formed by extending the sides:**\n\
  \   - When the sides of the pentagon are extended, they form a five-pointed star.\n\
  \   - The star consists of five outer points (like point \\( A \\)) and five intersections\
  \ inside the pentagon.\n\n3. **Determine the angle at point \\( A \\):**\n   - The\
  \ angle at each outer point of the star (like \\( A \\)) is known as the \"point\
  \ angle\" of the star.\n   - For a regular five-pointed star, the point angle \\\
  ( A \\) can be calculated using the formula for the angles of a regular star polygon.\n\
  \   - The formula for the point angle of a regular star polygon with \\( n \\) points\
  \ is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Point Angle} = \\frac{180^\\circ}{n}\n     \\]\n  \
  \   where \\( n \\) is the number of points in the star.\n\n4. **Apply the formula:**\n\
  \   - For a five-pointed star (\\( n = 5 \\)):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Point Angle}\
  \ = \\frac{180^\\circ}{5} = 36^\\circ\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle\
  \ \\( A \\) is \\( 36^\\circ \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(36^\\\
  circ\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
