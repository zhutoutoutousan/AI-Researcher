answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- Denali is responsible\
  \ for 16 dogs.\n- Nate is responsible for 12 dogs.\n- Dogs are assigned or unassigned\
  \ in groups of \\( x \\) dogs.\n- The ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's pay remains\
  \ the same under two scenarios:\n  1. Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, and Nate\
  \ stays at 12 dogs.\n  2. \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali.\n\n\
  **Step 1: Set up the initial ratio.**\nThe initial ratio of Denali's pay to Nate's\
  \ pay is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first\
  \ scenario.**\nIn the first scenario, Denali walks \\( 4x \\) more dogs, so Denali's\
  \ total dogs become \\( 16 + 4x \\). Nate's dogs remain at 12. The ratio of their\
  \ pay is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second scenario.**\n\
  In the second scenario, \\( x \\) of Nate's dogs are reassigned to Denali. Denali's\
  \ total dogs become \\( 16 + x \\), and Nate's total dogs become \\( 12 - x \\).\
  \ The ratio of their pay is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + x}{12 - x}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Equate\
  \ the two ratios.**\nSince the ratio of their pay remains the same in both scenarios,\
  \ we set the two ratios equal to each other:\n\\[\n\\frac{16 + 4x}{12} = \\frac{16\
  \ + x}{12 - x}.\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for \\( x \\).**\nCross-multiply to solve\
  \ for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n(16 + 4x)(12 - x) = (16 + x)(12).\n\\]\n\nExpand both sides:\n\
  \\[\n192 - 16x + 48x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x.\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n192 +\
  \ 32x - 4x^2 = 192 + 12x.\n\\]\n\nSubtract \\( 192 + 12x \\) from both sides:\n\\\
  [\n20x - 4x^2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\( 4x \\):\n\\[\n4x(5 - x) = 0.\n\\]\n\n\
  Since \\( x \\neq 0 \\), we have:\n\\[\n5 - x = 0 \\implies x = 5.\n\\]\n\n**Final\
  \ Answer: The final answer is \\( 5 \\). I hope it is correct.**"

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
