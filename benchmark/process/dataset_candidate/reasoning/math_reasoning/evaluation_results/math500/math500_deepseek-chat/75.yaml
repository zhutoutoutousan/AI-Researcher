answer: "To determine the probability that the product of two numbers rolled on fair\
  \ 6-sided dice is a multiple of 5, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Total possible\
  \ outcomes**: Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of possible outcomes when\
  \ two dice are thrown is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n\n2. **Favorable outcomes**: For\
  \ the product of the two numbers to be a multiple of 5, at least one of the numbers\
  \ must be a multiple of 5. On a 6-sided die, the multiples of 5 are 5 itself. Therefore,\
  \ we need at least one die to show a 5.\n\n3. **Counting favorable outcomes**:\n\
  \   - First, count the number of outcomes where the first die is 5. There are 6\
  \ possible outcomes for the second die, so this gives us 6 favorable outcomes.\n\
  \   - Next, count the number of outcomes where the second die is 5. Again, there\
  \ are 6 possible outcomes for the first die, so this gives us another 6 favorable\
  \ outcomes.\n   - However, we have double-counted the outcome where both dice are\
  \ 5. There is only 1 such outcome.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of favorable\
  \ outcomes is \\(6 + 6 - 1 = 11\\).\n\n4. **Probability calculation**: The probability\
  \ is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\
  \ Thus, the probability is \\(\\frac{11}{36}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(\\frac{11}{36}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
