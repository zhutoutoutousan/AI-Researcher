answer: 'To compute \(17^{-1} \pmod{83}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that:


  \[

  17x \equiv 1 \pmod{83}.

  \]


  We are given the hint that \(17 \cdot 5 = 85\). Notice that:


  \[

  85 \equiv 85 - 83 = 2 \pmod{83}.

  \]


  Thus, \(17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}\). To make the right-hand side equal to 1,
  we can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 83. First, we find
  \(2^{-1} \pmod{83}\), which is a number \(y\) such that:


  \[

  2y \equiv 1 \pmod{83}.

  \]


  By inspection, \(2 \cdot 42 = 84 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}\), so \(2^{-1} \equiv 42 \pmod{83}\).


  Now, multiply both sides of \(17 \cdot 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{83}\) by 42:


  \[

  17 \cdot 5 \cdot 42 \equiv 2 \cdot 42 \pmod{83}.

  \]


  Simplify the right-hand side:


  \[

  2 \cdot 42 = 84 \equiv 1 \pmod{83}.

  \]


  Thus:


  \[

  17 \cdot (5 \cdot 42) \equiv 1 \pmod{83}.

  \]


  This shows that \(5 \cdot 42 = 210\) is a solution for \(x\). However, we need to
  reduce \(210\) modulo 83:


  \[

  210 \div 83 = 2 \text{ with a remainder of } 210 - 83 \cdot 2 = 210 - 166 = 44.

  \]


  Thus, \(210 \equiv 44 \pmod{83}\), and we conclude:


  \[

  17^{-1} \equiv 44 \pmod{83}.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(44\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
