answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to calculate the future value of an investment
  that earns compound interest bi-monthly (every two months) over a period of five
  years.


  ### Step 1: Determine the number of compounding periods

  The investment earns interest every two months, and there are 12 months in a year.
  Therefore, the number of compounding periods per year is:

  \[

  \frac{12 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months}} = 6 \text{ periods per year}.

  \]

  Over five years, the total number of compounding periods is:

  \[

  6 \text{ periods/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 30 \text{ periods}.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Use the compound interest formula

  The formula for the future value \( FV \) of an investment with compound interest
  is:

  \[

  FV = P \times (1 + r)^n,

  \]

  where:

  - \( P \) is the principal amount (\$24,000),

  - \( r \) is the interest rate per period (1%, or 0.01),

  - \( n \) is the total number of compounding periods (30).


  Substitute the values into the formula:

  \[

  FV = 24000 \times (1 + 0.01)^{30}.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Calculate the future value

  First, calculate \( (1 + 0.01)^{30} \):

  \[

  (1.01)^{30} \approx 1.3478489.

  \]

  Now multiply by the principal:

  \[

  FV = 24000 \times 1.3478489 \approx 32348.37.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Round to the nearest whole number

  The future value is approximately \$32,348.37. Rounding to the nearest whole number
  gives:

  \[

  FV \approx 32348.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is $32348$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
