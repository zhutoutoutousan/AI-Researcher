answer: 'To find the quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \), we can
  use the **Remainder Theorem** or **Polynomial Long Division**. Here, we will use
  the **Remainder Theorem** for simplicity.


  ### Step 1: Apply the Remainder Theorem

  The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x
  - a \), the remainder is \( f(a) \). Here, \( f(x) = x^9 + 1 \) and \( a = 1 \).
  Thus, the remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x - 1 \) is:

  \[

  f(1) = 1^9 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Use the Factor Theorem

  The Factor Theorem tells us that if \( f(a) = 0 \), then \( x - a \) is a factor
  of \( f(x) \). Since \( f(1) = 2 \neq 0 \), \( x - 1 \) is **not** a factor of \(
  x^9 + 1 \). This means the division will leave a remainder.


  ### Step 3: Find the Quotient

  To find the quotient, we can use the formula for dividing a polynomial by \( x -
  a \):

  \[

  f(x) = (x - a) \cdot Q(x) + R,

  \]

  where \( Q(x) \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder. Here, \( a = 1 \),
  \( R = 2 \), and \( f(x) = x^9 + 1 \). Thus:

  \[

  x^9 + 1 = (x - 1) \cdot Q(x) + 2.

  \]

  Rearranging, we get:

  \[

  (x - 1) \cdot Q(x) = x^9 + 1 - 2 = x^9 - 1.

  \]

  Now, divide both sides by \( x - 1 \) to solve for \( Q(x) \):

  \[

  Q(x) = \frac{x^9 - 1}{x - 1}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Simplify the Quotient

  The expression \( \frac{x^9 - 1}{x - 1} \) is a geometric series. The sum of the
  geometric series \( 1 + x + x^2 + \dots + x^{n-1} \) is:

  \[

  \frac{x^n - 1}{x - 1}.

  \]

  For \( n = 9 \), this becomes:

  \[

  \frac{x^9 - 1}{x - 1} = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 + x^8.

  \]

  Thus, the quotient is:

  \[

  Q(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 + x^8.

  \]


  ### Final Answer

  The quotient when \( x^9 + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \) is:

  \[

  1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 + x^8.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 +
  x^8 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
