answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to maximize the area of the rectangular field
  enclosed by the athletic track. The track consists of two straight edges (the lengths
  of the rectangle) and two semicircles (the widths of the rectangle).


  ### Step 1: Define the variables

  Let:

  - \( L \) be the length of the rectangle (the straight edges of the track).

  - \( W \) be the width of the rectangle (the diameter of the semicircles).


  ### Step 2: Express the perimeter of the track

  The perimeter of the track consists of:

  - Two straight edges of length \( L \).

  - Two semicircles with diameter \( W \), which together form a full circle with
  circumference \( \pi W \).


  Thus, the total perimeter \( P \) is:

  \[

  P = 2L + \pi W.

  \]

  We are given that the perimeter is 400 meters:

  \[

  2L + \pi W = 400.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Express \( L \) in terms of \( W \)

  Solve for \( L \):

  \[

  2L = 400 - \pi W \implies L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Express the area of the rectangle

  The area \( A \) of the rectangle is:

  \[

  A = L \cdot W.

  \]

  Substitute \( L \) from Step 3:

  \[

  A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) \cdot W = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Maximize the area

  To find the maximum area, take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \)
  and set it to zero:

  \[

  \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W.

  \]

  Set the derivative equal to zero:

  \[

  200 - \pi W = 0 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}.

  \]


  ### Step 6: Find \( L \) using the value of \( W \)

  Substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) into the expression for \( L \):

  \[

  L = 200 - \frac{\pi \cdot \frac{200}{\pi}}{2} = 200 - 100 = 100.

  \]


  ### Step 7: Calculate the maximum area

  The maximum area is:

  \[

  A = L \cdot W = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\frac{20000}{\pi}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
