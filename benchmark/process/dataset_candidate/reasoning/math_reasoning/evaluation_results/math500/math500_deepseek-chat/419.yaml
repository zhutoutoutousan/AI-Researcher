answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to find the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) with the
  smallest magnitude such that:


  \[

  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 90
  \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]


  ### Step 1: Cross Product Formula

  The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3
  \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\)
  is given by:


  \[

  \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} a_2 v_3 - a_3 v_2 \\ a_3 v_1 - a_1
  v_3 \\ a_1 v_2 - a_2 v_1 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]


  Substituting \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{a}
  \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}\), we get the system
  of equations:


  \[

  \begin{cases}

  2v_3 - (-5)v_2 = 90, \\

  -5v_1 - 1v_3 = 30, \\

  1v_2 - 2v_1 = 30.

  \end{cases}

  \]


  Simplifying, we have:


  \[

  \begin{cases}

  2v_3 + 5v_2 = 90, \\

  -5v_1 - v_3 = 30, \\

  v_2 - 2v_1 = 30.

  \end{cases}

  \]


  ### Step 2: Solve the System of Equations

  From the third equation, \(v_2 = 2v_1 + 30\). Substitute \(v_2\) into the first
  equation:


  \[

  2v_3 + 5(2v_1 + 30) = 90 \implies 2v_3 + 10v_1 + 150 = 90 \implies 2v_3 + 10v_1
  = -60 \implies v_3 + 5v_1 = -30.

  \]


  From the second equation, \(-5v_1 - v_3 = 30\). Substitute \(v_3 = -30 - 5v_1\)
  into this equation:


  \[

  -5v_1 - (-30 - 5v_1) = 30 \implies -5v_1 + 30 + 5v_1 = 30 \implies 30 = 30.

  \]


  This is an identity, meaning the system has infinitely many solutions. The general
  solution is:


  \[

  v_1 = t, \quad v_2 = 2t + 30, \quad v_3 = -30 - 5t,

  \]


  where \(t\) is a parameter.


  ### Step 3: Find the Vector with the Smallest Magnitude

  The magnitude of \(\mathbf{v}\) is:


  \[

  \|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2} = \sqrt{t^2 + (2t + 30)^2 + (-30 -
  5t)^2}.

  \]


  Expanding and simplifying:


  \[

  \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = t^2 + (4t^2 + 120t + 900) + (25t^2 + 300t + 900) = 30t^2 + 420t
  + 1800.

  \]


  To minimize \(\|\mathbf{v}\|\), we minimize \(\|\mathbf{v}\|^2\). Taking the derivative
  with respect to \(t\) and setting it to zero:


  \[

  \frac{d}{dt} \|\mathbf{v}\|^2 = 60t + 420 = 0 \implies t = -7.

  \]


  Substituting \(t = -7\) into the expressions for \(v_1\), \(v_2\), and \(v_3\):


  \[

  v_1 = -7, \quad v_2 = 2(-7) + 30 = 16, \quad v_3 = -30 - 5(-7) = 5.

  \]


  Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{v}\) with the smallest magnitude is:


  \[

  \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Verify the Solution

  We verify that this vector satisfies the original cross product equation:


  \[

  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} -7 \\ 16 \\ 5
  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \cdot 5 - (-5) \cdot 16 \\ -5 \cdot (-7) - 1 \cdot
  5 \\ 1 \cdot 16 - 2 \cdot (-7) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 10 + 80 \\ 35 - 5
  \\ 16 + 14 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 90 \\ 30 \\ 30 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]


  The solution is correct.
