answer: "To determine which student has the greatest average speed, we need to analyze\
  \ the graph. The graph plots distance (y-axis) against time (x-axis). The average\
  \ speed of a student is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Speed} = \\\
  frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}}\n\\]\n\nFrom the graph, we can estimate the\
  \ coordinates of each student's position:\n\n- **Evelyn**: (1.25, 4.5)\n- **Briana**:\
  \ (2.5, 2.2)\n- **Carla**: (4.25, 5.2)\n- **Debra**: (5.6, 2.8)\n- **Angela**: (6.8,\
  \ 1.4)\n\nNow, let's calculate the average speed for each student:\n\n1. **Evelyn**:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{4.5}{1.25} = 3.6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Briana**:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{2.2}{2.5} = 0.88\n   \\]\n\n3. **Carla**:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{5.2}{4.25} \\approx 1.22\n   \\]\n\n\
  4. **Debra**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{2.8}{5.6} = 0.5\n   \\\
  ]\n\n5. **Angela**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{1.4}{6.8} \\approx\
  \ 0.206\n   \\]\n\nFrom these calculations, **Evelyn** has the greatest average\
  \ speed of **3.6**.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is Evelyn. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
