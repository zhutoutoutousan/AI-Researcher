answer: 'To find the value of \( y \), we use the formula for the projection of a
  vector \(\mathbf{v}\) onto a vector \(\mathbf{u}\):


  \[

  \text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \left( \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u}
  \cdot \mathbf{u}} \right) \mathbf{u}.

  \]


  Given:

  \[

  \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ y \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{u} = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \text{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{5}{6}
  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]


  First, compute \(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

  \[

  \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.

  \]


  Next, compute \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}\):

  \[

  \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} = 2 \cdot 1 + y \cdot (-2) + (-5) \cdot 1 = 2 - 2y -
  5 = -3 - 2y.

  \]


  The projection formula gives:

  \[

  \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} = \frac{-3 - 2y}{6}.

  \]


  According to the problem, this scalar is \(\frac{5}{6}\):

  \[

  \frac{-3 - 2y}{6} = \frac{5}{6}.

  \]


  Multiply both sides by 6:

  \[

  -3 - 2y = 5.

  \]


  Solve for \( y \):

  \[

  -2y = 5 + 3 \implies -2y = 8 \implies y = -4.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(-4\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
