answer: "To solve the problem, we need to factor the quadratic expression \\(10x^2\
  \ - x - 24\\) into the form \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\
  \ integers. Then, we will find the value of \\(AB + B\\).\n\n### Step 1: Expand\
  \ \\((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\\)\nExpanding the factored form:\n\\[\n(Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) =\
  \ ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24.\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\nABx^2 + (3A - 8B)x - 24.\n\
  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Compare coefficients\nThe expanded form must match the original\
  \ quadratic expression \\(10x^2 - x - 24\\). Therefore:\n1. \\(AB = 10\\) (coefficient\
  \ of \\(x^2\\)),\n2. \\(3A - 8B = -1\\) (coefficient of \\(x\\)),\n3. \\(-24 = -24\\\
  ) (constant term, which is already satisfied).\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\(A\\)\
  \ and \\(B\\)\nWe need to find integer values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that \\\
  (AB = 10\\) and \\(3A - 8B = -1\\).\n\n#### Possible integer pairs \\((A, B)\\)\
  \ where \\(AB = 10\\):\n- \\((1, 10)\\),\n- \\((2, 5)\\),\n- \\((5, 2)\\),\n- \\\
  ((10, 1)\\),\n- \\((-1, -10)\\),\n- \\((-2, -5)\\),\n- \\((-5, -2)\\),\n- \\((-10,\
  \ -1)\\).\n\n#### Test these pairs in \\(3A - 8B = -1\\):\n- For \\((2, 5)\\):\n\
  \  \\[\n  3(2) - 8(5) = 6 - 40 = -34 \\neq -1.\n  \\]\n- For \\((5, 2)\\):\n  \\\
  [\n  3(5) - 8(2) = 15 - 16 = -1.\n  \\]\n  This pair satisfies both equations.\n\
  \nThus, \\(A = 5\\) and \\(B = 2\\).\n\n### Step 4: Compute \\(AB + B\\)\n\\[\n\
  AB + B = (5)(2) + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12.\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\\
  (12\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
