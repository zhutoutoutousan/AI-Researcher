answer: "To find the largest possible value of \\( |a| + |b| + |c| \\) given the constraint\
  \ \\( |ax^2 + bx + c| \\le 1 \\) for all \\( 0 \\le x \\le 1 \\), we proceed as\
  \ follows:\n\n1. **Evaluate the inequality at key points**:\n   - At \\( x = 0 \\\
  ): \\( |c| \\le 1 \\).\n   - At \\( x = 1 \\): \\( |a + b + c| \\le 1 \\).\n   -\
  \ At \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\): \\( \\left| \\frac{a}{4} + \\frac{b}{2} + c \\right|\
  \ \\le 1 \\).\n\n2. **Consider the extreme cases**:\n   - To maximize \\( |a| +\
  \ |b| + |c| \\), we need to consider the maximum possible values of \\( |a| \\),\
  \ \\( |b| \\), and \\( |c| \\) while satisfying the constraints.\n\n3. **Assume\
  \ \\( c = 1 \\)**:\n   - From \\( |c| \\le 1 \\), the maximum \\( c \\) can be is\
  \ 1.\n   - Substituting \\( c = 1 \\) into \\( |a + b + c| \\le 1 \\), we get \\\
  ( |a + b + 1| \\le 1 \\), which implies \\( a + b \\le 0 \\) and \\( a + b \\ge\
  \ -2 \\).\n\n4. **Substitute \\( c = 1 \\) into the inequality at \\( x = \\frac{1}{2}\
  \ \\)**:\n   - \\( \\left| \\frac{a}{4} + \\frac{b}{2} + 1 \\right| \\le 1 \\).\n\
  \   - This implies \\( \\frac{a}{4} + \\frac{b}{2} \\le 0 \\) and \\( \\frac{a}{4}\
  \ + \\frac{b}{2} \\ge -2 \\).\n\n5. **Solve the system of inequalities**:\n   -\
  \ From \\( a + b \\le 0 \\) and \\( \\frac{a}{4} + \\frac{b}{2} \\le 0 \\), we can\
  \ solve for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - Let \\( a = -2 \\) and \\( b = 2 \\).\
  \ Then \\( a + b = 0 \\) and \\( \\frac{a}{4} + \\frac{b}{2} = 0 \\), which satisfies\
  \ all the inequalities.\n\n6. **Calculate \\( |a| + |b| + |c| \\)**:\n   - \\( |a|\
  \ + |b| + |c| = | -2 | + | 2 | + | 1 | = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 \\).\n\n7. **Verify if this\
  \ is the maximum**:\n   - Any other combination of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\\
  ( c \\) that satisfies the constraints will result in \\( |a| + |b| + |c| \\le 5\
  \ \\).\n\nThus, the largest possible value of \\( |a| + |b| + |c| \\) is \\( 5 \\\
  ).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $5$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
