answer: "To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of\
  \ 6432 and 132, and then increase it by 11.\n\n### Step 1: Find the GCF of 6432\
  \ and 132\nWe can use the **Euclidean algorithm** to find the GCF.\n\n1. Divide\
  \ 6432 by 132:\n   \\[\n   6432 \\div 132 = 48 \\text{ with a remainder of } 96.\n\
  \   \\]\n   So, \\(6432 = 132 \\times 48 + 96\\).\n\n2. Now, divide 132 by the remainder\
  \ 96:\n   \\[\n   132 \\div 96 = 1 \\text{ with a remainder of } 36.\n   \\]\n \
  \  So, \\(132 = 96 \\times 1 + 36\\).\n\n3. Next, divide 96 by the remainder 36:\n\
  \   \\[\n   96 \\div 36 = 2 \\text{ with a remainder of } 24.\n   \\]\n   So, \\\
  (96 = 36 \\times 2 + 24\\).\n\n4. Now, divide 36 by the remainder 24:\n   \\[\n\
  \   36 \\div 24 = 1 \\text{ with a remainder of } 12.\n   \\]\n   So, \\(36 = 24\
  \ \\times 1 + 12\\).\n\n5. Finally, divide 24 by the remainder 12:\n   \\[\n   24\
  \ \\div 12 = 2 \\text{ with a remainder of } 0.\n   \\]\n   So, \\(24 = 12 \\times\
  \ 2 + 0\\).\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the GCF of 6432 and 132 is **12**.\n\
  \n### Step 2: Increase the GCF by 11\nNow, add 11 to the GCF:\n\\[\n12 + 11 = 23.\n\
  \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe result is **23**.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is 23. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
