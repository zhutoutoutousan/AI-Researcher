answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible values
  for \( a \) given the conditions:

  - \(\gcd(a, b) = 210\)

  - \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = 210^3\)

  - \(a < b\)


  ### Step 1: Express \( a \) and \( b \) in terms of their gcd

  Let \( a = 210 \cdot m \) and \( b = 210 \cdot n \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are
  positive integers such that \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\) (since 210 is the greatest common
  divisor of \( a \) and \( b \)).


  ### Step 2: Use the relationship between gcd and lcm

  We know that:

  \[

  \gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = a \cdot b

  \]

  Substituting the given values:

  \[

  210 \cdot 210^3 = (210 \cdot m) \cdot (210 \cdot n)

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  210^4 = 210^2 \cdot m \cdot n

  \]

  Divide both sides by \( 210^2 \):

  \[

  210^2 = m \cdot n

  \]

  So:

  \[

  m \cdot n = 210^2

  \]


  ### Step 3: Factorize \( 210^2 \)

  First, factorize 210:

  \[

  210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7

  \]

  Thus:

  \[

  210^2 = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7)^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^2

  \]


  ### Step 4: Determine the number of coprime pairs \( (m, n) \)

  Since \(\gcd(m, n) = 1\), \( m \) and \( n \) must be coprime. This means that for
  each prime factor in \( 210^2 \), either \( m \) or \( n \) must contain all the
  powers of that prime, but not both.


  For each prime factor (2, 3, 5, 7), there are 2 choices:

  - Assign all powers of the prime to \( m \).

  - Assign all powers of the prime to \( n \).


  Since there are 4 distinct prime factors, the total number of coprime pairs \( (m,
  n) \) is:

  \[

  2^4 = 16

  \]


  ### Step 5: Account for the condition \( a < b \)

  Since \( a = 210 \cdot m \) and \( b = 210 \cdot n \), the condition \( a < b \)
  implies \( m < n \). For each coprime pair \( (m, n) \), exactly one of \( m < n
  \) or \( n < m \) holds. Therefore, half of the 16 pairs will satisfy \( m < n \).


  Thus, the number of valid pairs is:

  \[

  \frac{16}{2} = 8

  \]


  ### Final Answer

  There are 8 possible values for \( a \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
