answer: "To determine the domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{2-x}{\\log(2-\\\
  log(x-2))} \\), we need to consider the restrictions imposed by the logarithm functions\
  \ and the denominator.\n\n1. **Logarithm in the denominator**: The argument of the\
  \ logarithm must be positive. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   2 - \\log(x-2) > 0.\n   \\\
  ]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\log(x-2) < 2.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\log\\) is\
  \ the base 10 logarithm, this inequality can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   x - 2\
  \ < 10^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x - 2 < 100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x < 102.\n\
  \   \\]\n\n2. **Logarithm in the argument**: The argument of the logarithm must\
  \ also be positive. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 > 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\
  \ x > 2.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Denominator cannot be zero**: The denominator \\(\\log(2-\\\
  log(x-2))\\) must not be zero. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\log(2-\\log(x-2)) \\neq\
  \ 0.\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   2 - \\log(x-2) \\neq 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow\
  \ \\quad \\log(x-2) \\neq 1.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\log\\) is the base 10 logarithm,\
  \ this inequality can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 \\neq 10^1 \\quad \\Rightarrow\
  \ \\quad x \\neq 12.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combining all conditions**: From the above,\
  \ we have:\n   \\[\n   2 < x < 102 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x \\neq 12.\n   \\\
  ]\n\nThus, the domain of the function \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\\[\n(2, 12) \\cup (12,\
  \ 102).\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\((2, 12) \\cup (12, 102)\\).\
  \ I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
