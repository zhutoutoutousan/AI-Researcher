answer: "Let's solve the inequalities step by step.\n\n1. **First Inequality:** \\\
  (0 \\ge 54p - 144\\)  \n   Add \\(144\\) to both sides:  \n   \\[\n   144 \\ge 54p\n\
  \   \\]  \n   Divide both sides by \\(54\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{144}{54} \\ge\
  \ p \\implies \\frac{8}{3} \\ge p \\implies p \\le \\frac{8}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second\
  \ Inequality:** \\(0 > 12 - 20p\\)  \n   Subtract \\(12\\) from both sides:  \n\
  \   \\[\n   -12 > -20p\n   \\]  \n   Divide both sides by \\(-20\\) (remember to\
  \ reverse the inequality sign when dividing by a negative number):  \n   \\[\n \
  \  \\frac{-12}{-20} < p \\implies \\frac{3}{5} < p.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the\
  \ Inequalities:**  \n   From the first inequality, we have \\(p \\le \\frac{8}{3}\\\
  ).  \n   From the second inequality, we have \\(p > \\frac{3}{5}\\).  \n   Therefore,\
  \ the solution is:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{5} < p \\le \\frac{8}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n\
  In interval notation, this is \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{8}{3}\\right]\\).\n\
  \nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{8}{3}\\right]\\\
  ). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
