answer: 'To find the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by \(11\), we
  can use modular arithmetic.


  ### Step 1: Simplify \(129 \mod 11\)

  First, compute \(129 \mod 11\):

  \[

  129 \div 11 = 11 \text{ with a remainder of } 8.

  \]

  So, \(129 \equiv 8 \mod 11\).


  ### Step 2: Simplify \(96 \mod 11\)

  Next, compute \(96 \mod 11\):

  \[

  96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ with a remainder of } 8.

  \]

  So, \(96 \equiv 8 \mod 11\).


  ### Step 3: Compute \(129^{34} \mod 11\)

  Since \(129 \equiv 8 \mod 11\), we have:

  \[

  129^{34} \equiv 8^{34} \mod 11.

  \]

  Now, observe that \(8^1 \equiv 8 \mod 11\), \(8^2 \equiv 64 \equiv 9 \mod 11\),
  \(8^3 \equiv 72 \equiv 6 \mod 11\), \(8^4 \equiv 48 \equiv 4 \mod 11\), \(8^5 \equiv
  32 \equiv 10 \mod 11\), and \(8^6 \equiv 80 \equiv 3 \mod 11\). Notice that \(8^6
  \equiv 3 \mod 11\), and \(8^{12} \equiv (8^6)^2 \equiv 3^2 \equiv 9 \mod 11\). Continuing
  this pattern, we find that \(8^{30} \equiv 1 \mod 11\) (since \(8^{30} = (8^6)^5
  \equiv 3^5 \equiv 243 \equiv 1 \mod 11\)). Therefore:

  \[

  8^{34} = 8^{30} \cdot 8^4 \equiv 1 \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \mod 11.

  \]

  So, \(129^{34} \equiv 4 \mod 11\).


  ### Step 4: Compute \(96^{38} \mod 11\)

  Since \(96 \equiv 8 \mod 11\), we have:

  \[

  96^{38} \equiv 8^{38} \mod 11.

  \]

  Using the same pattern as before, \(8^6 \equiv 3 \mod 11\), and \(8^{36} = (8^6)^6
  \equiv 3^6 \equiv 729 \equiv 1 \mod 11\). Therefore:

  \[

  8^{38} = 8^{36} \cdot 8^2 \equiv 1 \cdot 9 \equiv 9 \mod 11.

  \]

  So, \(96^{38} \equiv 9 \mod 11\).


  ### Step 5: Add the results

  Now, add the two results:

  \[

  129^{34} + 96^{38} \equiv 4 + 9 \equiv 13 \mod 11.

  \]

  Since \(13 \mod 11 = 2\), the remainder is \(2\).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
