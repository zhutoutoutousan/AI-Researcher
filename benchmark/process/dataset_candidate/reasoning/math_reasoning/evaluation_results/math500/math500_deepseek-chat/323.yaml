answer: "To determine the probability that segments \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) intersect\
  \ when four points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) are chosen randomly\
  \ and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can proceed with the following\
  \ reasoning:\n\n1. **Total number of ways to choose 4 points on a circle**: \n \
  \  Since the points are distinct and the circle is symmetric, the total number of\
  \ ways to choose 4 points on a circle is simply the number of ways to arrange 4\
  \ distinct points, which is \\( 4! = 24 \\).\n\n2. **Favorable arrangements where\
  \ \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) intersect**:\n   For segments \\( AB \\) and \\( CD\
  \ \\) to intersect, the four points must be arranged in such a way that one point\
  \ from each segment alternates around the circle. Specifically, the points must\
  \ be in the order \\( A \\), \\( C \\), \\( B \\), \\( D \\) or \\( A \\), \\( D\
  \ \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders). \n\n  \
  \ There are exactly 2 such alternating arrangements for each set of 4 points:\n\
  \   - \\( A \\), \\( C \\), \\( B \\), \\( D \\)\n   - \\( A \\), \\( D \\), \\\
  ( B \\), \\( C \\)\n\n   Since there are 4 points, there are \\( 4 \\times 2 = 8\
  \ \\) favorable arrangements where \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) intersect.\n\n3. **Probability\
  \ calculation**:\n   The probability \\( P \\) that \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) intersect\
  \ is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements:\n\
  \   \\[\n   P = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\\text{Total number\
  \ of arrangements}} = \\frac{8}{24} = \\frac{1}{3}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability\
  \ that segments \\( AB \\) and \\( CD \\) intersect is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
