answer: 'Let the number be \( x \). According to the problem, the number is one less
  than twice its reciprocal. This can be written as:


  \[

  x = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{x} - 1

  \]


  Multiply both sides by \( x \) to eliminate the fraction:


  \[

  x^2 = 2 - x

  \]


  Rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation:


  \[

  x^2 + x - 2 = 0

  \]


  Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2
  - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -2 \):


  \[

  x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-2)}}{2 \cdot 1}

  \]


  \[

  x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2}

  \]


  \[

  x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2}

  \]


  \[

  x = \frac{-1 \pm 3}{2}

  \]


  This gives two solutions:


  \[

  x = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-4}{2} = -2

  \]


  Since we are looking for the smallest number, the answer is \( -2 \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(-2\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
