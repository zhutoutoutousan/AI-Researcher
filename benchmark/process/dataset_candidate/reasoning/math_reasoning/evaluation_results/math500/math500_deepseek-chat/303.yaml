answer: "To solve the problem, let's analyze the given trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) with \\\
  (\\overline{AD} \\parallel \\overline{BC}\\). We are given the following:\n\n1.\
  \ \\(\\overline{AC} \\perp \\overline{CD}\\),\n2. \\(\\overline{AC}\\) bisects \\\
  (\\angle BAD\\),\n3. The area of the trapezoid \\([ABCD] = 42\\).\n\nWe need to\
  \ find the area of \\(\\triangle ACD\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties\
  \ of the trapezoid\nSince \\(AD \\parallel BC\\), the trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) has two\
  \ parallel sides. The diagonal \\(\\overline{AC}\\) is perpendicular to \\(\\overline{CD}\\\
  ), meaning \\(\\angle ACD = 90^\\circ\\). Additionally, \\(\\overline{AC}\\) bisects\
  \ \\(\\angle BAD\\), so \\(\\angle BAC = \\angle CAD\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze\
  \ \\(\\triangle ACD\\)\nLet \\(\\angle BAC = \\angle CAD = \\theta\\). Since \\\
  (\\overline{AC}\\) bisects \\(\\angle BAD\\), we can write \\(\\angle BAD = 2\\\
  theta\\). \n\nIn \\(\\triangle ACD\\), we have:\n- \\(\\angle CAD = \\theta\\),\n\
  - \\(\\angle ACD = 90^\\circ\\),\n- \\(\\angle ADC = 90^\\circ - \\theta\\).\n\n\
  ---\n\n### Step 3: Relate the areas\nThe trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) can be divided into\
  \ two triangles: \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\). The total area of\
  \ the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of these two triangles:\n\\[\n[ABCD] = [\\\
  triangle ABC] + [\\triangle ACD].\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\overline{AC}\\) bisects \\\
  (\\angle BAD\\), the heights of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\) relative\
  \ to the base \\(\\overline{AC}\\) are equal. This means the areas of \\(\\triangle\
  \ ABC\\) and \\(\\triangle ACD\\) are proportional to their bases.\n\n---\n\n###\
  \ Step 4: Compute the area of \\(\\triangle ACD\\)\nLet the area of \\(\\triangle\
  \ ACD\\) be \\(x\\). Then the area of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is also \\(x\\) because\
  \ the heights are equal and the bases are proportional. Thus:\n\\[\n[ABCD] = x +\
  \ x = 2x.\n\\]\n\nGiven \\([ABCD] = 42\\), we have:\n\\[\n2x = 42 \\implies x =\
  \ 21.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(21\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
