answer: 'To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph
  of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we minimize the distance function \( D
  \) from the origin \((0, 0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance squared
  is:


  \[

  D^2 = x^2 + y^2.

  \]


  Substitute \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into \( D^2 \):


  \[

  D^2 = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2
  - 3)^2.

  \]


  Expand and simplify:


  \[

  D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}.

  \]


  Combine like terms:


  \[

  D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}.

  \]


  To minimize \( D^2 \), take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to
  zero:


  \[

  \frac{d}{dx}(D^2) = 2x^3 - 4x = 0.

  \]


  Factor out \( 2x \):


  \[

  2x(x^2 - 2) = 0.

  \]


  Solve for \( x \):


  \[

  x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}.

  \]


  Evaluate \( D^2 \) at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):


  \[

  D^2 = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2)
  + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.

  \]


  Thus, the smallest distance is:


  \[

  D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}.

  \]


  The expression \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \) matches the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}
  \), where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since \( 10 \) is square-free, we have \(
  a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
