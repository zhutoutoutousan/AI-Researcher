answer: 'To find the minimum value of the expression:


  \[

  \sqrt{x^2 + 400} + \sqrt{y^2 + 900} + \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100},

  \]


  we can analyze the expression step by step.


  ### Step 1: Rewrite the expression

  First, let''s rewrite the expression in a more manageable form. Notice that:


  \[

  \sqrt{x^2 + 400} = \sqrt{x^2 + 20^2},

  \]

  \[

  \sqrt{y^2 + 900} = \sqrt{y^2 + 30^2},

  \]

  \[

  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - 80x - 100y + 4100} = \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2}.

  \]


  Thus, the expression becomes:


  \[

  \sqrt{x^2 + 20^2} + \sqrt{y^2 + 30^2} + \sqrt{(x-40)^2 + (y-50)^2}.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Interpret the expression geometrically

  The expression represents the sum of distances:

  - From the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((0, 0)\) with an additional vertical
  distance of 20.

  - From the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((0, 0)\) with an additional horizontal
  distance of 30.

  - From the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((40, 50)\).


  ### Step 3: Find the minimum value

  To minimize the sum of these distances, we can use the concept of the **Fermat point**
  (or geometric median). The Fermat point minimizes the total distance to three given
  points.


  In this case, the Fermat point is the point \((x, y)\) that minimizes the sum of
  distances to \((0, 0)\), \((0, 0)\) with an offset, and \((40, 50)\). The minimum
  occurs when \((x, y)\) is the Fermat point of the triangle formed by these points.


  After some geometric analysis, we find that the minimum value of the expression
  is:


  \[

  \sqrt{40^2 + 50^2} = \sqrt{1600 + 2500} = \sqrt{4100} = 10\sqrt{41}.

  \]


  ### Final Answer:

  The final answer is \(10\sqrt{41}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
