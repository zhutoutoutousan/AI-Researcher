answer: "To determine the type of graph represented by the equation \\(\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\
  \ - 3\\right)^2 + y^2 = 10\\), let's analyze it step by step.\n\n1. **Rewrite the\
  \ equation**:  \n   The given equation is \\(\\left(\\frac{x}{2} - 3\\right)^2 +\
  \ y^2 = 10\\).  \n   Let\u2019s rewrite \\(\\frac{x}{2}\\) as \\(\\frac{1}{2}x\\\
  ), so the equation becomes:  \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x - 3\\right)^2 + y^2\
  \ = 10.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand the squared term**:  \n   Expand \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x\
  \ - 3\\right)^2\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x - 3\\right)^2 = \\left(\\\
  frac{1}{2}x\\right)^2 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}x \\cdot 3 + 3^2 = \\frac{1}{4}x^2\
  \ - 3x + 9.\n   \\]  \n   Substituting back into the equation:  \n   \\[\n   \\\
  frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3x + 9 + y^2 = 10.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the equation**:  \n\
  \   Subtract 10 from both sides to set the equation to zero:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4}x^2\
  \ - 3x + 9 + y^2 - 10 = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{4}x^2 - 3x + y^2 - 1 = 0.\n   \\]\
  \  \n   Multiply through by 4 to eliminate the fraction:  \n   \\[\n   x^2 - 12x\
  \ + 4y^2 - 4 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Complete the square for \\(x\\)**:  \n   To complete\
  \ the square for \\(x\\), take the coefficient of \\(x\\), which is \\(-12\\), halve\
  \ it to get \\(-6\\), and square it to get \\(36\\). Add and subtract \\(36\\) inside\
  \ the equation:  \n   \\[\n   x^2 - 12x + 36 - 36 + 4y^2 - 4 = 0 \\implies (x -\
  \ 6)^2 - 36 + 4y^2 - 4 = 0.\n   \\]  \n   Combine the constants:  \n   \\[\n   (x\
  \ - 6)^2 + 4y^2 - 40 = 0 \\implies (x - 6)^2 + 4y^2 = 40.\n   \\]  \n   Divide through\
  \ by 40 to get the standard form:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \\frac{4y^2}{40}\
  \ = 1 \\implies \\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \\frac{y^2}{10} = 1.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Identify\
  \ the graph**:  \n   The equation \\(\\frac{(x - 6)^2}{40} + \\frac{y^2}{10} = 1\\\
  ) is in the standard form of an ellipse:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} +\
  \ \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1,\n   \\]  \n   where \\((h, k)\\) is the center, and\
  \ \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.  \n\
  \   Therefore, the graph is an **ellipse**.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is\
  \ ellipse. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
