answer: "To solve the inequality \\( x^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10 \\), follow these steps:\n\
  \n1. **Move all terms to one side to form a standard quadratic inequality:**\n \
  \  \\[\n   x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \\le 0\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 5x -\
  \ 14 \\le 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Factor the quadratic expression:**\n   We look for two\
  \ numbers that multiply to \\(-14\\) and add to \\(-5\\). These numbers are \\(-7\\\
  ) and \\(2\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)\n   \\]\n   So the inequality\
  \ becomes:\n   \\[\n   (x - 7)(x + 2) \\le 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the critical points:**\n\
  \   Set each factor equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   x - 7 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 7\n  \
  \ \\]\n   \\[\n   x + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -2\n   \\]\n   These critical points\
  \ divide the number line into three intervals:\n   - \\( x < -2 \\)\n   - \\( -2\
  \ \\le x \\le 7 \\)\n   - \\( x > 7 \\)\n\n4. **Test each interval to determine\
  \ where the inequality holds:**\n   - For \\( x < -2 \\), choose \\( x = -3 \\):\n\
  \     \\[\n     (-3 - 7)(-3 + 2) = (-10)(-1) = 10 > 0\n     \\]\n     The inequality\
  \ \\( (x - 7)(x + 2) \\le 0 \\) does not hold here.\n   - For \\( -2 \\le x \\le\
  \ 7 \\), choose \\( x = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     (0 - 7)(0 + 2) = (-7)(2) = -14 \\\
  le 0\n     \\]\n     The inequality holds here.\n   - For \\( x > 7 \\), choose\
  \ \\( x = 8 \\):\n     \\[\n     (8 - 7)(8 + 2) = (1)(10) = 10 > 0\n     \\]\n \
  \    The inequality does not hold here.\n\n5. **Include the critical points:**\n\
  \   At \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\), the expression equals zero, so they are\
  \ included in the solution.\n\n6. **Write the solution in interval notation:**\n\
  \   The inequality holds for \\( x \\) in the interval \\([-2, 7]\\).\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\([-2, 7]\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
