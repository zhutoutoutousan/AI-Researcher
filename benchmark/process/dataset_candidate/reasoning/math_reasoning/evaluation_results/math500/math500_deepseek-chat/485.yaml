answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path that starts at any
  one of the points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) and visits the other three
  points exactly once. This is essentially a traveling salesman problem (TSP) for
  four points.


  ### Step 1: List all possible routes

  There are \( 4! = 24 \) possible routes, but since the starting point is fixed (we
  can choose any of the four points as the starting point), we only need to consider
  \( 3! = 6 \) routes for each starting point.


  ### Step 2: Calculate the total distance for each route

  We will calculate the total distance for each possible route and then find the minimum.


  #### Starting at \( A \):

  1. \( A \to B \to C \to D \): \( 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 \)

  2. \( A \to B \to D \to C \): \( 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 \)

  3. \( A \to C \to B \to D \): \( 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \)

  4. \( A \to C \to D \to B \): \( 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 \)

  5. \( A \to D \to B \to C \): \( 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \)

  6. \( A \to D \to C \to B \): \( 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \)


  The shortest distance starting at \( A \) is \( 13 \).


  #### Starting at \( B \):

  1. \( B \to A \to C \to D \): \( 6 + 6 + 4 = 16 \)

  2. \( B \to A \to D \to C \): \( 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 \)

  3. \( B \to C \to A \to D \): \( 5 + 6 + 5 = 16 \)

  4. \( B \to C \to D \to A \): \( 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \)

  5. \( B \to D \to A \to C \): \( 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 \)

  6. \( B \to D \to C \to A \): \( 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 \)


  The shortest distance starting at \( B \) is \( 13 \).


  #### Starting at \( C \):

  1. \( C \to A \to B \to D \): \( 6 + 6 + 3 = 15 \)

  2. \( C \to A \to D \to B \): \( 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \)

  3. \( C \to B \to A \to D \): \( 5 + 6 + 5 = 16 \)

  4. \( C \to B \to D \to A \): \( 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \)

  5. \( C \to D \to A \to B \): \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)

  6. \( C \to D \to B \to A \): \( 4 + 3 + 6 = 13 \)


  The shortest distance starting at \( C \) is \( 13 \).


  #### Starting at \( D \):

  1. \( D \to A \to B \to C \): \( 5 + 6 + 5 = 16 \)

  2. \( D \to A \to C \to B \): \( 5 + 6 + 5 = 16 \)

  3. \( D \to B \to A \to C \): \( 3 + 6 + 6 = 15 \)

  4. \( D \to B \to C \to A \): \( 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 \)

  5. \( D \to C \to A \to B \): \( 4 + 6 + 6 = 16 \)

  6. \( D \to C \to B \to A \): \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)


  The shortest distance starting at \( D \) is \( 14 \).


  ### Step 3: Find the overall shortest distance

  The shortest distances for each starting point are:

  - Starting at \( A \): \( 13 \)

  - Starting at \( B \): \( 13 \)

  - Starting at \( C \): \( 13 \)

  - Starting at \( D \): \( 14 \)


  The overall shortest distance is \( 13 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
