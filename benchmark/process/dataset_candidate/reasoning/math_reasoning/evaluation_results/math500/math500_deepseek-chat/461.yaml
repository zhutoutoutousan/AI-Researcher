answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) at three
  different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function
  \( f(n) \) is defined piecewise as follows:


  \[

  f(n) = \left\{

  \begin{array}{cl}

  \lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\

  \lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.

  \end{array}

  \right.

  \]


  Let''s evaluate each term step by step.


  ---


  ### 1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):

  - \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), which is less than 4.

  - Since \( n < 4 \), we use \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).

  - \( \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

  - Thus, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).


  ---


  ### 2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):

  - \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), which is greater than or equal to 4.

  - Since \( n \geq 4 \), we use \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).

  - \( \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

  - Thus, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).


  ---


  ### 3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):

  - \( 8^{2/3} = (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \), which is equal to 4.

  - Since \( n \geq 4 \), we use \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).

  - \( \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

  - Thus, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).


  ---


  ### 4. Sum the results:

  Now, we add the three evaluated terms:

  \[

  f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
