answer: "To find the angle between the two lines, we first determine the direction\
  \ vectors of each line.\n\n1. **First Line:**\n   The equation \\(2x = 3y = -z\\\
  ) can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{y}{\\frac{1}{3}}\
  \ = \\frac{z}{-1}\n   \\]\n   This gives the direction vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_1 =\
  \ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, -1\\right)\\).\n\n2. **Second Line:**\n   The\
  \ equation \\(6x = -y = -4z\\) can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x}{\\frac{1}{6}}\
  \ = \\frac{y}{-1} = \\frac{z}{-\\frac{1}{4}}\n   \\]\n   This gives the direction\
  \ vector \\(\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}, -1, -\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\).\n\
  \n3. **Normalize the Direction Vectors:**\n   To find the angle between the lines,\
  \ we use the dot product formula:\n   \\[\n   \\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_1\
  \ \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2}{\\|\\mathbf{v}_1\\| \\|\\mathbf{v}_2\\|}\n   \\]\n   First,\
  \ compute the dot product \\(\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2\\):\n   \\[\n  \
  \ \\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\\
  right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)(-1) + (-1)\\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\\
  frac{1}{12} - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12}\
  \ = 0\n   \\]\n   Since the dot product is 0, the vectors are perpendicular, and\
  \ the angle between them is \\(90^\\circ\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is\
  \ \\(90\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
