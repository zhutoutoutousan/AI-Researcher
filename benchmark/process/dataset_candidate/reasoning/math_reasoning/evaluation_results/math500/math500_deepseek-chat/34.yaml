answer: 'To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\),
  we use the binomial expansion formula:


  \[

  (a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k

  \]


  Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in
  the expansion is:


  \[

  \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k

  \]


  Simplify the exponents of \(x\):


  \[

  (10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}

  \]


  \[

  \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \cdot \frac{1}{2^k} \cdot x^{-2k}

  \]


  Combine these to get the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:


  \[

  x^{15-3k} \cdot x^{-2k} = x^{15-5k}

  \]


  We want the constant term, which means the exponent of \(x\) should be zero:


  \[

  15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3

  \]


  Now substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term:


  \[

  \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2
  \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

  \]


  Calculate each part:


  \[

  \binom{5}{3} = 10

  \]


  \[

  (10x^3)^2 = 100x^6

  \]


  \[

  \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}

  \]


  Multiply these together:


  \[

  10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
  = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

  \]


  Thus, the constant term is \(-125\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(-125$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
