answer: 'To solve this problem, let''s analyze the given parallelograms and their
  areas step by step.


  ### Step 1: Understand the parallelograms

  The first parallelogram is bounded by the lines:

  - \( y = ax + c \),

  - \( y = ax + d \),

  - \( y = bx + c \),

  - \( y = bx + d \).


  The second parallelogram is bounded by the lines:

  - \( y = ax + c \),

  - \( y = ax - d \),

  - \( y = bx + c \),

  - \( y = bx - d \).


  ### Step 2: Find the area of the first parallelogram

  The area of a parallelogram bounded by lines of the form \( y = mx + c_1 \) and
  \( y = mx + c_2 \) (with the same slope \( m \)) and lines of the form \( y = nx
  + c_3 \) and \( y = nx + c_4 \) (with the same slope \( n \)) is given by:

  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{|c_2 - c_1| \cdot |d_2 - d_1|}{|m - n|},

  \]

  where \( c_1, c_2 \) are the intercepts of the first pair of lines, and \( d_1,
  d_2 \) are the intercepts of the second pair of lines.


  For the first parallelogram:

  - The vertical distance between \( y = ax + c \) and \( y = ax + d \) is \( |d -
  c| \).

  - The vertical distance between \( y = bx + c \) and \( y = bx + d \) is \( |d -
  c| \).

  - The horizontal distance between the lines \( y = ax + c \) and \( y = bx + c \)
  is \( \frac{|c - c|}{|a - b|} = 0 \), but this is not correct. Instead, the correct
  formula for the area is:

  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{|d - c| \cdot |d - c|}{|a - b|} = \frac{(d - c)^2}{|a - b|}.

  \]

  Given that the area is 18, we have:

  \[

  \frac{(d - c)^2}{|a - b|} = 18.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Find the area of the second parallelogram

  For the second parallelogram:

  - The vertical distance between \( y = ax + c \) and \( y = ax - d \) is \( |c -
  (-d)| = c + d \).

  - The vertical distance between \( y = bx + c \) and \( y = bx - d \) is \( |c -
  (-d)| = c + d \).

  - The horizontal distance between the lines \( y = ax + c \) and \( y = bx + c \)
  is \( \frac{|c - c|}{|a - b|} = 0 \), but again, the correct formula for the area
  is:

  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{(c + d)^2}{|a - b|}.

  \]

  Given that the area is 72, we have:

  \[

  \frac{(c + d)^2}{|a - b|} = 72.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Relate the two areas

  From the first parallelogram:

  \[

  \frac{(d - c)^2}{|a - b|} = 18.

  \]

  From the second parallelogram:

  \[

  \frac{(c + d)^2}{|a - b|} = 72.

  \]

  Divide the second equation by the first:

  \[

  \frac{(c + d)^2}{(d - c)^2} = \frac{72}{18} = 4.

  \]

  Taking the square root of both sides:

  \[

  \frac{c + d}{d - c} = 2.

  \]

  Solve for \( c \) and \( d \):

  \[

  c + d = 2(d - c),

  \]

  \[

  c + d = 2d - 2c,

  \]

  \[

  3c = d.

  \]

  Thus, \( d = 3c \).


  ### Step 5: Substitute back into the first equation

  Substitute \( d = 3c \) into the first area equation:

  \[

  \frac{(3c - c)^2}{|a - b|} = 18,

  \]

  \[

  \frac{(2c)^2}{|a - b|} = 18,

  \]

  \[

  \frac{4c^2}{|a - b|} = 18.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  \frac{4c^2}{|a - b|} = 18 \implies \frac{c^2}{|a - b|} = \frac{18}{4} = \frac{9}{2}.

  \]

  Thus:

  \[

  c^2 = \frac{9}{2} |a - b|.

  \]


  ### Step 6: Find integer solutions

  Since \( a, b, c, d \) are positive integers, \( |a - b| \) must be a positive integer.
  Let \( |a - b| = k \), where \( k \) is a positive integer. Then:

  \[

  c^2 = \frac{9}{2} k.

  \]

  For \( c^2 \) to be an integer, \( k \) must be even. Let \( k = 2m \), where \(
  m \) is a positive integer. Then:

  \[

  c^2 = \frac{9}{2} \cdot 2m = 9m.

  \]

  Thus, \( c = 3\sqrt{m} \). For \( c \) to be an integer, \( m \) must be a perfect
  square. Let \( m = n^2 \), where \( n \) is a positive integer. Then:

  \[

  c = 3n.

  \]

  Since \( d = 3c \), we have:

  \[

  d = 9n.

  \]

  Now, \( |a - b| = k = 2m = 2n^2 \).


  ### Step 7: Minimize \( a + b + c + d \)

  We want to minimize \( a + b + c + d \). Since \( c = 3n \) and \( d = 9n \), we
  have:

  \[

  a + b + c + d = a + b + 3n + 9n = a + b + 12n.

  \]

  To minimize this, we need to minimize \( a + b \) and \( n \).


  Since \( |a - b| = 2n^2 \), the smallest possible value of \( n \) is 1 (since \(
  n \) is a positive integer). For \( n = 1 \):

  \[

  |a - b| = 2(1)^2 = 2.

  \]

  To minimize \( a + b \), we choose the smallest possible values of \( a \) and \(
  b \) such that \( |a - b| = 2 \). Let \( a = b + 2 \). Then:

  \[

  a + b = (b + 2) + b = 2b + 2.

  \]

  The smallest possible value of \( b \) is 1 (since \( b \) is a positive integer).
  Thus:

  \[

  a + b = 2(1) + 2 = 4.

  \]

  Now, \( c = 3n = 3(1) = 3 \), and \( d = 9n = 9(1) = 9 \). Therefore:

  \[

  a + b + c + d = 4 + 3 + 9 = 16.

  \]


  ### Step 8: Verify the solution

  For \( n = 1 \), \( a = 3 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 3 \), and \( d = 9 \):

  - The first parallelogram has area:

  \[

  \frac{(d - c)^2}{|a - b|} = \frac{(9 - 3)^2}{|3 - 1|} = \frac{6^2}{2} = \frac{36}{2}
  = 18.

  \]

  - The second parallelogram has area:

  \[

  \frac{(c + d)^2}{|a - b|} = \frac{(3 + 9)^2}{|3 - 1|} = \frac{12^2}{2} = \frac{144}{2}
  = 72.

  \]

  Both areas match the given conditions.


  ### Final Answer

  The smallest possible value of \( a + b + c + d \) is \( 16 \).
