answer: "To determine the area of the gray piece in the tangram, let's analyze the\
  \ given information step by step.\n\n1. **Area of the Square \\(ABCD\\):**\n   The\
  \ area of square \\(ABCD\\) is 16 square inches. Since the area of a square is given\
  \ by the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\text{side}^2 \\), we can find the side length:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\text{side} = \\sqrt{16} = 4 \\text{ inches}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understanding\
  \ the Tangram Pieces:**\n   The tangram consists of several isosceles triangles\
  \ and one smaller square (piece \"e\"). The gray piece is a right triangle formed\
  \ by the intersection of the diagonals and other lines within the square.\n\n3.\
  \ **Dimensions of the Gray Piece:**\n   The gray triangle has legs that are half\
  \ the length of the square's side. Since the side of the square is 4 inches, the\
  \ legs of the gray triangle are:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Leg}_1 = \\text{Leg}_2 = \\\
  frac{4}{2} = 2 \\text{ inches}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Area of the Gray Triangle:**\n \
  \  The area of a right triangle is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2}\
  \ \\times \\text{Leg}_1 \\times \\text{Leg}_2.\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2 \\text{ square inches}.\n\
  \   \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(2\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
