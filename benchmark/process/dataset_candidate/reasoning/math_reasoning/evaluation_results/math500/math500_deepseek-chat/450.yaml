answer: 'To solve the congruence \(14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}\), we first simplify it
  by dividing both sides by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 14 and 100. The GCD
  of 14 and 100 is 2, so we divide both sides of the congruence by 2:


  \[

  14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100} \implies 7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}.

  \]


  Next, we solve for \(u\) by finding the modular inverse of 7 modulo 50. The modular
  inverse of 7 modulo 50 is a number \(x\) such that \(7x \equiv 1 \pmod{50}\). Using
  the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find that \(x = 43\) because \(7 \cdot 43 =
  301 \equiv 1 \pmod{50}\).


  Now, multiply both sides of the simplified congruence \(7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}\)
  by 43:


  \[

  u \equiv 23 \cdot 43 \pmod{50}.

  \]


  Calculate \(23 \cdot 43\):


  \[

  23 \cdot 43 = 989.

  \]


  Now, reduce 989 modulo 50:


  \[

  989 \div 50 = 19 \text{ with a remainder of } 39, \text{ so } 989 \equiv 39 \pmod{50}.

  \]


  Thus, the smallest positive integer solution is \(u = 39\). The next solution is
  obtained by adding 50 (the modulus) to 39, giving \(u = 89\).


  The two smallest positive integer solutions are \(u = 39\) and \(u = 89\). The average
  of these two solutions is:


  \[

  \frac{39 + 89}{2} = \frac{128}{2} = 64.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(64\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
