answer: "To solve the inequality \\(-4 < x^{4} + 4x^{2} < 21\\), we analyze the expression\
  \ \\(x^{4} + 4x^{2}\\) step by step.\n\n1. **Analyze the left inequality: \\(-4\
  \ < x^{4} + 4x^{2}\\)**\n   - The expression \\(x^{4} + 4x^{2}\\) is always non-negative\
  \ because \\(x^{4} \\geq 0\\) and \\(4x^{2} \\geq 0\\) for all real \\(x\\). Therefore,\
  \ \\(x^{4} + 4x^{2} \\geq 0\\), which is always greater than \\(-4\\). This inequality\
  \ holds for all real \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Analyze the right inequality: \\(x^{4} + 4x^{2}\
  \ < 21\\)**\n   - Let \\(y = x^{2}\\). Then the inequality becomes \\(y^{2} + 4y\
  \ - 21 < 0\\).\n   - Solve \\(y^{2} + 4y - 21 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula:\n\
  \     \\[\n     y = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{100}}{2}\
  \ = \\frac{-4 \\pm 10}{2}.\n     \\]\n     The solutions are \\(y = 3\\) and \\\
  (y = -7\\). Since \\(y = x^{2}\\) must be non-negative, we discard \\(y = -7\\)\
  \ and consider \\(y = 3\\).\n   - The inequality \\(y^{2} + 4y - 21 < 0\\) holds\
  \ for \\(y\\) in the interval \\((-7, 3)\\). Since \\(y = x^{2} \\geq 0\\), we restrict\
  \ this to \\(y \\in [0, 3)\\).\n   - Thus, \\(x^{2} < 3\\), which implies \\(x \\\
  in (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   - The left inequality\
  \ \\(-4 < x^{4} + 4x^{2}\\) holds for all real \\(x\\).\n   - The right inequality\
  \ \\(x^{4} + 4x^{2} < 21\\) holds for \\(x \\in (-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\).\n  \
  \ - Therefore, the solution to the original inequality is \\(x \\in (-\\sqrt{3},\
  \ \\sqrt{3})\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\((-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})\\\
  ). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
