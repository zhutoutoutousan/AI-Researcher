answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that a randomly selected
  integer from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\) is divisible by 2 but not divisible
  by 3.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Count the number of integers divisible by 2.

  An integer is divisible by 2 if it is even. The set \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\)
  contains 100 integers, and half of them are even. Therefore:

  \[

  \text{Number of integers divisible by 2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50.

  \]

  ### Step 2: Count the number of integers divisible by both 2 and 3.

  An integer divisible by both 2 and 3 is divisible by the least common multiple (LCM)
  of 2 and 3, which is 6. The number of integers in \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\) divisible
  by 6 is:

  \[

  \text{Number of integers divisible by 6} = \left\lfloor \frac{100}{6} \right\rfloor
  = 16.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Subtract the number of integers divisible by both 2 and 3 from the number
  of integers divisible by 2.

  To find the number of integers divisible by 2 but not divisible by 3, subtract the
  number of integers divisible by both 2 and 3 from the total number of integers divisible
  by 2:

  \[

  \text{Number of integers divisible by 2 but not by 3} = 50 - 16 = 34.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Compute the probability.

  The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (integers divisible by 2 but
  not by 3) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (100 integers). Therefore:

  \[

  \text{Probability} = \frac{34}{100} = \frac{17}{50}.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
