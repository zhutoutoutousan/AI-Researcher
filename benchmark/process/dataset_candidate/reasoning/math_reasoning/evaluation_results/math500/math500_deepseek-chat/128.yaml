answer: "To determine the fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February, let's\
  \ break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the problem**: Suzanne\
  \ walks 4 miles every third day. We need to find the minimum total miles she can\
  \ walk in February.\n\n2. **Determine the number of days in February**: February\
  \ typically has 28 days (in a non-leap year). However, since the problem does not\
  \ specify the year, we will assume it is a non-leap year with 28 days.\n\n3. **Calculate\
  \ the number of walking days**: Suzanne walks every third day. To find the minimum\
  \ number of walking days, we divide the total number of days in February by 3:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\frac{28}{3} = 9 \\text{ (since she cannot walk a fraction of a day)}\n\
  \   \\]\n   So, Suzanne walks on 9 days in February.\n\n4. **Calculate the total\
  \ miles walked**: Since Suzanne walks 4 miles on each of these 9 days, the total\
  \ miles walked is:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 4 = 36 \\text{ miles}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\
  \ The fewest number of miles Suzanne can walk in February is 36.\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is 36. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
