answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - You\
  \ have 7 bags of gold coins, each with the same number of coins. Let the number\
  \ of coins in each bag be \\( x \\).\n   - The total number of coins before finding\
  \ the new bag is \\( 7x \\).\n\n2. **After Finding the New Bag**:\n   - You find\
  \ a bag of 53 coins, so the total number of coins becomes \\( 7x + 53 \\).\n\n3.\
  \ **Redistribution**:\n   - You redistribute all the coins into 8 bags, each with\
  \ the same number of coins. This means \\( 7x + 53 \\) must be divisible by 8.\n\
  \   - Therefore, \\( 7x + 53 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8} \\).\n\n4. **Simplify the Congruence**:\n\
  \   - Since \\( 7 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{8} \\), the congruence becomes:\n     \\[\n\
  \     -x + 53 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify \\( 53 \\pmod{8} \\\
  ):\n     \\[\n     53 \\div 8 = 6 \\text{ with a remainder of } 5, \\text{ so }\
  \ 53 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}.\n     \\]\n   - The congruence now becomes:\n     \\[\n\
  \     -x + 5 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{8}.\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\\
  [\n     -x \\equiv -5 \\pmod{8} \\implies x \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}.\n     \\]\n   -\
  \ This means \\( x = 8k + 5 \\) for some integer \\( k \\geq 0 \\).\n\n5. **Total\
  \ Coins Constraint**:\n   - The total number of coins after redistribution is \\\
  ( 7x + 53 \\), and this must be greater than 200:\n     \\[\n     7x + 53 > 200.\n\
  \     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( x = 8k + 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     7(8k + 5) + 53 >\
  \ 200.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     56k + 35 + 53 > 200 \\implies 56k\
  \ + 88 > 200.\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 88 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     56k >\
  \ 112.\n     \\]\n   - Divide by 56:\n     \\[\n     k > 2.\n     \\]\n   - Since\
  \ \\( k \\) is an integer, the smallest possible value for \\( k \\) is 3.\n\n6.\
  \ **Calculate \\( x \\)**:\n   - Substitute \\( k = 3 \\) into \\( x = 8k + 5 \\\
  ):\n     \\[\n     x = 8(3) + 5 = 24 + 5 = 29.\n     \\]\n\n7. **Total Coins Before\
  \ Finding the New Bag**:\n   - The total number of coins before finding the new\
  \ bag is \\( 7x = 7(29) = 203 \\).\n\n8. **Verification**:\n   - After finding the\
  \ new bag, the total number of coins is \\( 203 + 53 = 256 \\).\n   - Redistributing\
  \ 256 coins into 8 bags gives \\( 256 \\div 8 = 32 \\) coins per bag, which is valid.\n\
  \   - Also, \\( 256 > 200 \\), satisfying the constraint.\n\nThus, the smallest\
  \ number of coins you could have had before finding the bag of 53 coins is \\( 203\
  \ \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 203. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
