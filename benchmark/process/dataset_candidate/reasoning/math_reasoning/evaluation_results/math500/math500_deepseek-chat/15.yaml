answer: "To find \\( w \\), the result when \\( z \\) is rotated around \\( c \\)\
  \ by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) counter-clockwise, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express\
  \ \\( z \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of their real and imaginary parts:**\n   \\[\n\
  \   z = 2 + \\sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\\sqrt{2})i\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c = 2 - 3i\n   \\\
  ]\n\n2. **Translate \\( z \\) so that \\( c \\) is at the origin:**\n   \\[\n  \
  \ z' = z - c = (2 + \\sqrt{2} - 2) + (-3 - 3\\sqrt{2} - (-3))i = \\sqrt{2} - 3\\\
  sqrt{2}i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rotate \\( z' \\) by \\( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) counter-clockwise:**\n\
  \   The rotation of a complex number \\( z' = a + bi \\) by an angle \\( \\theta\
  \ \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   z'' = z' \\cdot (\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta)\n\
  \   \\]\n   For \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\cos \\\
  frac{\\pi}{4} = \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n   \\]\n   Thus:\n\
  \   \\[\n   z'' = (\\sqrt{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} +\
  \ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z'' = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\\
  sqrt{2}}{2} + \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\cdot \\frac{\\\
  sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\\sqrt{2}i \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}i\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z'' =\
  \ 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2\n   \\]\n   Since \\( i^2 = -1 \\):\n   \\[\n   z'' = 1 + i\
  \ - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i\n   \\]\n\n4. **Translate \\( z'' \\) back by adding \\( c \\\
  ):**\n   \\[\n   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\(6 - 5i\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
