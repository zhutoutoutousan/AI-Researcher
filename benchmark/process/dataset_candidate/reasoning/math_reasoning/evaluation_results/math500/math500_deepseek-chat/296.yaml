answer: 'To determine which equation has the largest solution for \( x \), we analyze
  the given equations:


  \[

  \textbf{(A)}\ 3(1 + r)^x = 7 \quad \textbf{(B)}\ 3(1 + r/10)^x = 7 \quad \textbf{(C)}\
  3(1 + 2r)^x = 7

  \]

  \[

  \textbf{(D)}\ 3(1 + \sqrt{r})^x = 7 \quad \textbf{(E)}\ 3(1 + 1/r)^x = 7

  \]


  Each equation can be rewritten in the form \( (1 + k)^x = \frac{7}{3} \), where
  \( k \) is a function of \( r \). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we
  get:


  \[

  x \cdot \ln(1 + k) = \ln\left(\frac{7}{3}\right)

  \]


  Thus, the solution for \( x \) is:


  \[

  x = \frac{\ln\left(\frac{7}{3}\right)}{\ln(1 + k)}

  \]


  Since \( \ln\left(\frac{7}{3}\right) \) is a positive constant, the value of \(
  x \) depends inversely on \( \ln(1 + k) \). Therefore, the smaller \( \ln(1 + k)
  \) is, the larger \( x \) will be.


  Now, we compare the values of \( k \) in each equation:


  - **(A):** \( k = r \)

  - **(B):** \( k = r/10 \)

  - **(C):** \( k = 2r \)

  - **(D):** \( k = \sqrt{r} \)

  - **(E):** \( k = 1/r \)


  Given \( 0 < r < 3 \), we analyze the behavior of \( k \):


  - **(A):** \( k = r \) is between \( 0 \) and \( 3 \).

  - **(B):** \( k = r/10 \) is between \( 0 \) and \( 0.3 \).

  - **(C):** \( k = 2r \) is between \( 0 \) and \( 6 \).

  - **(D):** \( k = \sqrt{r} \) is between \( 0 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \).

  - **(E):** \( k = 1/r \) is greater than \( 1/3 \) and can be very large as \( r
  \) approaches \( 0 \).


  The smallest \( k \) occurs in **(B)**, where \( k = r/10 \). Since \( \ln(1 + k)
  \) increases as \( k \) increases, the smallest \( \ln(1 + k) \) corresponds to
  the smallest \( k \). Therefore, **(B)** will have the largest \( x \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\textbf{B}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
