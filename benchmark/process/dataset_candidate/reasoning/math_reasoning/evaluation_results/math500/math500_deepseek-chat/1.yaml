answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to express the double sum \(\sum_{j = 1}^\infty
  \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\) in terms of \(p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
  \frac{1}{k^2}\) and \(q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}\).


  ### Step 1: Rewrite the Double Sum

  First, let''s rewrite the double sum by changing the variables. Let \(n = j + k\).
  For a fixed \(n\), the number of pairs \((j, k)\) such that \(j + k = n\) is \(n
  - 1\) (since \(j\) can range from 1 to \(n - 1\), and \(k = n - j\)). Thus, the
  double sum can be rewritten as:

  \[

  \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty
  \frac{n - 1}{n^3}.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Split the Sum

  Next, we split the sum into two parts:

  \[

  \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n}{n^3} - \sum_{n
  = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3} = \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} - \sum_{n = 2}^\infty
  \frac{1}{n^3}.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Express in Terms of \(p\) and \(q\)

  Recall that \(p = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}\) and \(q = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty
  \frac{1}{k^3}\). Therefore:

  \[

  \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{n = 2}^\infty
  \frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1.

  \]


  Substituting these into the expression, we get:

  \[

  \sum_{n = 2}^\infty \frac{n - 1}{n^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Final Answer

  Thus, the double sum \(\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\)
  can be expressed in terms of \(p\) and \(q\) as \(p - q\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(p - q\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
