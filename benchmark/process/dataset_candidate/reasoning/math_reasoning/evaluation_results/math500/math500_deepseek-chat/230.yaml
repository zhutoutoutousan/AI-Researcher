answer: 'To determine the maximum value of \( e \), we can use the method of Lagrange
  multipliers or apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Here, we will use the Cauchy-Schwarz
  inequality for simplicity.


  We are given:

  \[

  a + b + c + d + e = 8,

  \]

  \[

  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + e^2 = 16.

  \]


  Let \( S = a + b + c + d \) and \( Q = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 \). Then, we have:

  \[

  S + e = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad Q + e^2 = 16.

  \]


  We want to maximize \( e \). To do this, we need to minimize \( Q \) because \(
  Q = 16 - e^2 \). The minimum value of \( Q \) occurs when \( a = b = c = d \), due
  to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Let \( a = b = c = d = x \). Then:

  \[

  S = 4x \quad \text{and} \quad Q = 4x^2.

  \]


  Substituting into the equations:

  \[

  4x + e = 8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad e = 8 - 4x,

  \]

  \[

  4x^2 + e^2 = 16.

  \]


  Substitute \( e = 8 - 4x \) into the second equation:

  \[

  4x^2 + (8 - 4x)^2 = 16.

  \]

  \[

  4x^2 + 64 - 64x + 16x^2 = 16.

  \]

  \[

  20x^2 - 64x + 64 = 16.

  \]

  \[

  20x^2 - 64x + 48 = 0.

  \]

  \[

  5x^2 - 16x + 12 = 0.

  \]


  Solving this quadratic equation:

  \[

  x = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{(-16)^2 - 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 12}}{2 \cdot 5} = \frac{16 \pm
  \sqrt{256 - 240}}{10} = \frac{16 \pm \sqrt{16}}{10} = \frac{16 \pm 4}{10}.

  \]


  Thus, \( x = 2 \) or \( x = \frac{6}{5} \).


  If \( x = 2 \), then \( e = 8 - 4 \cdot 2 = 0 \).


  If \( x = \frac{6}{5} \), then \( e = 8 - 4 \cdot \frac{6}{5} = 8 - \frac{24}{5}
  = \frac{16}{5} \).


  The maximum value of \( e \) is \( \frac{16}{5} \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\frac{16}{5}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
