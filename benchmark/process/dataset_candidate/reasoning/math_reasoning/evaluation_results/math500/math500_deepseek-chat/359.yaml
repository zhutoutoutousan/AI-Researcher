answer: 'To solve for \( xy + yz + zx \), we will use the given equations and algebraic
  identities. Let''s proceed step by step.


  ### Step 1: Recall the identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \)

  The identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) is:

  \[

  x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz.

  \]

  We are given \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \) and \( xyz = 4 \). Substituting these into
  the identity:

  \[

  4 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 12.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = -8.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Recall the identity for \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2
  z \)

  The expression \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \) can be rewritten
  as:

  \[

  xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.

  \]

  We are given \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \) and \( xyz =
  4 \). Substituting these into the identity:

  \[

  12 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = 24.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Let \( S = x + y + z \) and \( P = xy + yz + zx \)

  From Step 1, we have:

  \[

  S^3 - 3SP = -8.

  \]

  From Step 2, we have:

  \[

  SP = 24.

  \]

  Substitute \( SP = 24 \) into the equation from Step 1:

  \[

  S^3 - 3(24) = -8.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  S^3 - 72 = -8.

  \]

  Solve for \( S^3 \):

  \[

  S^3 = 64.

  \]

  Take the cube root:

  \[

  S = 4.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Solve for \( P = xy + yz + zx \)

  From Step 2, we have \( SP = 24 \). Since \( S = 4 \), substitute:

  \[

  4P = 24.

  \]

  Solve for \( P \):

  \[

  P = 6.

  \]


  Thus, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is \( 6 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
