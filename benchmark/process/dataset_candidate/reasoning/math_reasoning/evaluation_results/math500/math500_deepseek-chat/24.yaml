answer: 'To determine the minimal compound interest rate required for the worker to
  have at least \$66,200 in the account by the end of the third year, we can use the
  formula for the future value of a series of deposits with compound interest:


  \[

  FV = P \cdot \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}

  \]


  Where:

  - \(FV\) is the future value (\$66,200),

  - \(P\) is the annual deposit (\$20,000),

  - \(r\) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),

  - \(n\) is the number of years (3).


  We need to solve for \(r\) such that:


  \[

  66,200 = 20,000 \cdot \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r}

  \]


  Divide both sides by 20,000:


  \[

  3.31 = \frac{(1 + r)^3 - 1}{r}

  \]


  This equation is not straightforward to solve algebraically, so we will use trial
  and error or numerical methods to approximate \(r\).


  Let''s test \(r = 0.10\) (10%):


  \[

  (1 + 0.10)^3 = 1.331

  \]

  \[

  \frac{1.331 - 1}{0.10} = \frac{0.331}{0.10} = 3.31

  \]


  This matches the required value of 3.31. Therefore, the minimal compound interest
  rate is 10%.


  Final Answer: The final answer is 10. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
