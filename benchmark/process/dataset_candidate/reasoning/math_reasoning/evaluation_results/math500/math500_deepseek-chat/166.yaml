answer: "To determine the degree measure of angle \\( BAC \\), let's analyze the given\
  \ figure step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Figure:**\n   - The figure consists\
  \ of a square and a regular heptagon sharing a common side \\( \\overline{AD} \\\
  ).\n   - The square has four right angles (90 degrees each).\n   - The regular heptagon\
  \ has seven equal sides and seven equal angles. Each internal angle of a regular\
  \ heptagon measures \\( \\frac{900}{7} \\) degrees.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Points:**\n\
  \   - Point \\( A \\) is a vertex shared by both the square and the heptagon.\n\
  \   - Point \\( B \\) is a vertex of the heptagon adjacent to \\( A \\).\n   - Point\
  \ \\( C \\) is a vertex of the square adjacent to \\( A \\).\n\n3. **Calculating\
  \ Angle \\( BAC \\):**\n   - The angle at vertex \\( A \\) of the heptagon is \\\
  ( \\frac{900}{7} \\) degrees.\n   - The angle at vertex \\( A \\) of the square\
  \ is 90 degrees.\n   - Since the square and heptagon share the side \\( \\overline{AD}\
  \ \\), the angle \\( BAC \\) is the difference between the heptagon's internal angle\
  \ and the square's right angle.\n\n4. **Final Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\angle\
  \ BAC = \\frac{900}{7} - 90 = \\frac{900}{7} - \\frac{630}{7} = \\frac{270}{7}\n\
  \   \\]\n\nThus, the degree measure of angle \\( BAC \\) is \\( \\frac{270}{7} \\\
  ).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{270}{7}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
