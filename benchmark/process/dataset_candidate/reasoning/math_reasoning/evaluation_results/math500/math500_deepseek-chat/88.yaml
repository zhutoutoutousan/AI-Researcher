answer: 'To determine the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( y = f(x)
  \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to ensure that the function
  \( f(x) \) covers all possible \( y \)-values. This means that the function must
  be surjective (onto) over its entire domain.


  ### Step 1: Analyze the function \( f(x) \)

  The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise:

  - For \( x \geq a \), \( f(x) = ax^2 \).

  - For \( x < a \), \( f(x) = ax + 2a \).


  ### Step 2: Determine the range of \( f(x) \)

  - For \( x \geq a \), \( f(x) = ax^2 \). Since \( x \geq a \), \( f(x) \) will take
  on all values from \( a^3 \) to \( \infty \) (assuming \( a > 0 \)).

  - For \( x < a \), \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). This is a linear function, and its range
  will be from \( -\infty \) to \( a^2 + 2a \).


  ### Step 3: Ensure the function covers all \( y \)-values

  For the function to intersect every horizontal line, the ranges of the two pieces
  must overlap. Specifically, the maximum value of the linear part (\( a^2 + 2a \))
  must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of the quadratic part (\( a^3
  \)):

  \[

  a^2 + 2a \geq a^3.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Solve the inequality

  Rearrange the inequality:

  \[

  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.

  \]

  Factor the left-hand side:

  \[

  a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.

  \]

  Factor further:

  \[

  a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Determine the critical points

  The critical points are \( a = -1 \), \( a = 0 \), and \( a = 2 \). We test the
  intervals determined by these points:

  - For \( a < -1 \), the inequality \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) is false.

  - For \( -1 \leq a \leq 0 \), the inequality is true.

  - For \( 0 < a < 2 \), the inequality is false.

  - For \( a \geq 2 \), the inequality is true.


  However, since \( a \) is a coefficient in the function \( f(x) \), and we are dealing
  with a piecewise function where \( x \geq a \) and \( x < a \), \( a \) must be
  positive. Therefore, the relevant interval is \( a \geq 2 \).


  ### Step 6: Find the largest \( a \)

  The largest value of \( a \) that satisfies the inequality \( a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq
  0 \) is \( a = 2 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
