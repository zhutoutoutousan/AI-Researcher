answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial number of books on\
  \ each shelf:**\n   - Top shelf: 8 mystery books.\n   - Middle shelf: 10 math books.\n\
  \   - Bottom shelf: 6 science books.\n   - Total books: \\(8 + 10 + 6 = 24\\).\n\
  \n2. **Books removed from each shelf:**\n   - 2 books are taken off each shelf.\n\
  \   - Top shelf after removal: \\(8 - 2 = 6\\) mystery books.\n   - Middle shelf\
  \ after removal: \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) math books.\n   - Bottom shelf after removal:\
  \ \\(6 - 2 = 4\\) science books.\n\n3. **Total number of books remaining:**\n  \
  \ - \\(6 + 8 + 4 = 18\\) books.\n\n4. **Number of math books remaining:**\n   -\
  \ There are 8 math books remaining on the middle shelf.\n\n5. **Fraction of math\
  \ books remaining:**\n   - The fraction is \\(\\frac{8}{18}\\).\n\n6. **Simplify\
  \ the fraction:**\n   - \\(\\frac{8}{18} = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The\
  \ final answer is \\(\\frac{4}{9}\\). I hope it is correct."
gt_answer: \frac{4}{9}
prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
