answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal
  asymptote, and then compute \(a + b + c\).


  ---


  ### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes

  Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of \(f(x)\) is zero (since the function
  is undefined at these points), and the numerator is not zero. The denominator of
  \(f(x)\) is:

  \[

  x^2 - 5x - 14.

  \]

  Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \(x\):

  \[

  x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0.

  \]

  This is a quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula:

  \[

  x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(-14)}}{2(1)} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 56}}{2}
  = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}.

  \]

  Thus, the solutions are:

  \[

  x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2.

  \]

  So, the vertical asymptotes are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). Therefore, \(a = 7\) and
  \(b = -2\).

  ### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote

  To find the horizontal asymptote, compare the degrees of the numerator and denominator
  of \(f(x)\). The numerator is \(2x\) (degree 1), and the denominator is \(x^2 -
  5x - 14\) (degree 2). Since the degree of the denominator is greater than the degree
  of the numerator, the horizontal asymptote is:

  \[

  y = 0.

  \]

  Thus, \(c = 0\).


  ---


  ### Step 3: Compute \(a + b + c\)

  Now, add the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

  \[

  a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
