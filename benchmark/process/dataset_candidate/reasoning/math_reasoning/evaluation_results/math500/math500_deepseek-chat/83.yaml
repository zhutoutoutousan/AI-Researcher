answer: "To solve the equation \\(3^{2x} + 19 = 10^x\\), we can proceed step by step:\n\
  \n1. **Rewrite the equation**:  \n   Notice that \\(3^{2x} = (3^2)^x = 9^x\\). So\
  \ the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   9^x + 19 = 10^x.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Rearrange the\
  \ equation**:  \n   Subtract \\(9^x\\) from both sides to isolate the exponential\
  \ terms:\n   \\[\n   10^x - 9^x = 19.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Test integer values for \\\
  (x\\)**:  \n   Since \\(10^x\\) grows faster than \\(9^x\\), we can test small integer\
  \ values for \\(x\\) to find a solution:\n   - For \\(x = 1\\): \\(10^1 - 9^1 =\
  \ 10 - 9 = 1 \\neq 19\\).\n   - For \\(x = 2\\): \\(10^2 - 9^2 = 100 - 81 = 19\\\
  ).\n\n   Thus, \\(x = 2\\) is a solution.\n\n4. **Verify uniqueness of the solution**:\
  \  \n   The function \\(f(x) = 10^x - 9^x\\) is strictly increasing for \\(x > 0\\\
  ) because its derivative \\(f'(x) = \\ln(10) \\cdot 10^x - \\ln(9) \\cdot 9^x\\\
  ) is positive for all \\(x > 0\\). Therefore, the equation \\(10^x - 9^x = 19\\\
  ) has exactly one solution, which is \\(x = 2\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(2\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
