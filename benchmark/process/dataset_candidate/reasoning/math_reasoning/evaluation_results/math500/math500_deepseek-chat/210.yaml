answer: "To find the total area of the shaded region, we analyze the given figure\
  \ step by step.\n\n1. The rectangle is formed by twelve 1 by 1 squares, so the rectangle\
  \ has dimensions \\(3 \\times 4\\) (since \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)).\n\n2. The shaded\
  \ region consists of two right triangles:\n   - The first triangle has vertices\
  \ at \\((0, 4)\\), \\((0, 0)\\), and \\((2, 0)\\). Its base is 2 units, and its\
  \ height is 4 units. The area of this triangle is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_1\
  \ = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times\
  \ 2 \\times 4 = 4.\n     \\]\n   - The second triangle has vertices at \\((0, 4)\\\
  ), \\((3, 4)\\), and \\((3, 0)\\). Its base is 3 units, and its height is 4 units.\
  \ The area of this triangle is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Area}_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\\
  times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times 4 = 6.\n\
  \     \\]\n\n3. The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these\
  \ two triangles:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Area} = \\text{Area}_1 + \\text{Area}_2\
  \ = 4 + 6 = 10.\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(10\\). I hope it\
  \ is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
