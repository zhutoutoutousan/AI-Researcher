answer: 'Let''s solve the problem step by step.


  ---


  **Step 1: Understand the problem.**


  We are given the cubic equation:

  \[

  8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0,

  \]

  which has three distinct positive roots. Let the roots be \( r_1, r_2, \) and \(
  r_3 \). We are also told that the sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is 5:

  \[

  \log_2(r_1) + \log_2(r_2) + \log_2(r_3) = 5.

  \]


  Our goal is to find the value of \( a \).


  ---


  **Step 2: Use Vieta''s formulas.**


  For a cubic equation of the form:

  \[

  8x^3 + 4ax^2 + 2bx + a = 0,

  \]

  the relationships between the coefficients and the roots are given by Vieta''s formulas:

  \[

  r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{4a}{8} = -\frac{a}{2},

  \]

  \[

  r_1r_2 + r_2r_3 + r_3r_1 = \frac{2b}{8} = \frac{b}{4},

  \]

  \[

  r_1r_2r_3 = -\frac{a}{8}.

  \]


  ---


  **Step 3: Use the logarithmic condition.**


  The sum of the base-2 logarithms of the roots is:

  \[

  \log_2(r_1) + \log_2(r_2) + \log_2(r_3) = 5.

  \]

  Using the logarithm property \( \log_2(r_1) + \log_2(r_2) + \log_2(r_3) = \log_2(r_1r_2r_3)
  \), we can rewrite this as:

  \[

  \log_2(r_1r_2r_3) = 5.

  \]

  Exponentiating both sides with base 2 gives:

  \[

  r_1r_2r_3 = 2^5 = 32.

  \]


  From Vieta''s formula, we know:

  \[

  r_1r_2r_3 = -\frac{a}{8}.

  \]

  Thus:

  \[

  -\frac{a}{8} = 32.

  \]

  Solving for \( a \):

  \[

  a = -32 \cdot 8 = -256.

  \]


  ---


  **Step 4: Verify the solution.**


  The value \( a = -256 \) satisfies the condition \( r_1r_2r_3 = 32 \), and the roots
  are positive because the product of the roots is positive. Therefore, the solution
  is valid.

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
