answer: "To simplify the expression \\(\\frac{\\sec x}{\\sin x} - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\\
  cos x}\\), let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Rewrite \\(\\sec x\\) in terms\
  \ of \\(\\cos x\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\sec x = \\frac{1}{\\cos x}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting\
  \ this into the expression gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\cos x}}{\\sin x}\
  \ - \\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the first term:**\n   \\\
  [\n   \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\cos x}}{\\sin x} = \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\cdot \\sin x}.\n\
  \   \\]\n\n3. **Rewrite the expression with a common denominator:**\n   The common\
  \ denominator for the two terms is \\(\\cos x \\cdot \\sin x\\). Rewrite the second\
  \ term to have this denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\cos x \\cdot \\sin x} -\
  \ \\frac{\\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\cdot \\sin x}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the terms:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\frac{1 - \\sin^2 x}{\\cos x \\cdot \\sin x}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Use the\
  \ Pythagorean identity \\(1 - \\sin^2 x = \\cos^2 x\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\\
  cos^2 x}{\\cos x \\cdot \\sin x}.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   \\\
  [\n   \\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x} = \\cot x.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the simplified form of\
  \ the expression is \\(\\cot x\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\cot\
  \ x\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
