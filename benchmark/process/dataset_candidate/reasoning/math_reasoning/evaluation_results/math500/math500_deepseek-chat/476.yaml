answer: "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distances walked by Jim and\
  \ Martha and then find the difference between them.\n\n1. **Jim's Path:**\n   -\
  \ Jim walks diagonally across the rectangular field.\n   - The field is 300 feet\
  \ wide and 400 feet long.\n   - The diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the\
  \ Pythagorean theorem:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Diagonal} = \\sqrt{(\\text{Width})^2\
  \ + (\\text{Length})^2} = \\sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Diagonal}\
  \ = \\sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \\sqrt{250000} = 500 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   -\
  \ So, Jim walks 500 feet.\n\n2. **Martha's Path:**\n   - Martha walks along the\
  \ length and width of the field.\n   - The total distance Martha walks is the sum\
  \ of the length and width:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Distance} = \\text{Width}\
  \ + \\text{Length} = 300 + 400 = 700 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n   - So, Martha walks\
  \ 700 feet.\n\n3. **Difference in Distance:**\n   - To find how many feet less Jim\
  \ walks compared to Martha:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Difference} = \\text{Martha's\
  \ Distance} - \\text{Jim's Distance} = 700 - 500 = 200 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\
  \   - Therefore, Jim walks 200 feet less than Martha.\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is 200. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\

question: Jim and Martha are standing together at the corner of a rectangular field.
  Jim walks diagonally across the field. Martha gets to the same location by walking
  along its length and width. The field is 300 feet wide and 400 feet long. How many
  feet less than Martha does Jim walk?
