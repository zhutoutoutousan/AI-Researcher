answer: "To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the first\
  \ six prime numbers**:  \n   The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and\
  \ 13.\n\n2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes**:  \n   Since both\
  \ Paul and Jesse choose a number independently from the six primes, the total number\
  \ of possible outcomes is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\).\n\n3. **Determine when the sum\
  \ of the two numbers is even**:  \n   The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers\
  \ are even or both numbers are odd.  \n   - Among the first six primes, only 2 is\
  \ even.  \n   - The other five primes (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd.\n\n4. **Calculate\
  \ the number of favorable outcomes**:  \n   - **Case 1: Both numbers are even**\
  \  \n     The only even number is 2. The number of ways both Paul and Jesse choose\
  \ 2 is \\(1 \\times 1 = 1\\).  \n   - **Case 2: Both numbers are odd**  \n     There\
  \ are five odd numbers. The number of ways both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number\
  \ is \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\).  \n   - Total favorable outcomes = \\(1 + 25 = 26\\\
  ).\n\n5. **Calculate the probability**:  \n   The probability that the sum of the\
  \ numbers they choose is even is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:\
  \  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{26}{36} = \\frac{13}{18}.\n   \\]\n\
  \nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{13}{18}\\). I hope it is correct."
gt_answer: \frac{13}{18}
prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
