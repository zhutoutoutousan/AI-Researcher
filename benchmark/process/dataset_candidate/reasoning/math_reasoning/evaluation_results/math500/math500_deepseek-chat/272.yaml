answer: "Let \\( x = 0.\\overline{1331} \\). This means \\( x = 0.133113311331\\ldots\
  \ \\).\n\nTo convert this repeating decimal into a fraction, we can use the following\
  \ steps:\n\n1. Let \\( x = 0.\\overline{1331} \\).\n2. Multiply both sides by \\\
  ( 10000 \\) (since the repeating block \"1331\" has 4 digits):\n   \\[\n   10000x\
  \ = 1331.\\overline{1331}.\n   \\]\n3. Subtract the original equation from this\
  \ new equation:\n   \\[\n   10000x - x = 1331.\\overline{1331} - 0.\\overline{1331}.\n\
  \   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   9999x = 1331.\n   \\]\n4. Solve for\
  \ \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1331}{9999}.\n   \\]\n5. Simplify the fraction\
  \ by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\
  \ The GCD of \\( 1331 \\) and \\( 9999 \\) is \\( 11 \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{1331\
  \ \\div 11}{9999 \\div 11} = \\frac{121}{909}.\n   \\]\n6. The fraction \\( \\frac{121}{909}\
  \ \\) is already in its simplest form since \\( 121 \\) and \\( 909 \\) have no\
  \ common divisors other than \\( 1 \\).\n\nThus, \\( a = 121 \\) and \\( b = 909\
  \ \\), so \\( a + b = 121 + 909 = 1030 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is\
  \ $1030$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
