answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the quadrilateral formed
  by the four points of tangency between the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \) and the parabola
  \( y^2 = 8x \).


  ---


  ### Step 1: Find the points of tangency

  The circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \) has a radius of \( \sqrt{2} \), and the parabola
  \( y^2 = 8x \) opens to the right. The common tangents to the circle and the parabola
  will touch the circle and the parabola at specific points.


  Let the equation of a tangent line to the parabola \( y^2 = 8x \) be:

  \[

  y = mx + \frac{2}{m},

  \]

  where \( m \) is the slope of the tangent. For this line to also be tangent to the
  circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 2 \), the distance from the center of the circle (which is
  at \( (0, 0) \)) to the line must equal the radius of the circle, \( \sqrt{2} \).


  The distance \( d \) from \( (0, 0) \) to the line \( y = mx + \frac{2}{m} \) is:

  \[

  d = \frac{\left| \frac{2}{m} \right|}{\sqrt{1 + m^2}}.

  \]

  Setting this equal to \( \sqrt{2} \), we get:

  \[

  \frac{\left| \frac{2}{m} \right|}{\sqrt{1 + m^2}} = \sqrt{2}.

  \]

  Squaring both sides and simplifying:

  \[

  \frac{4}{m^2(1 + m^2)} = 2 \implies 4 = 2m^2(1 + m^2) \implies 2 = m^2(1 + m^2).

  \]

  Let \( u = m^2 \). Then:

  \[

  u(1 + u) = 2 \implies u^2 + u - 2 = 0.

  \]

  Solving this quadratic equation:

  \[

  u = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm 3}{2}.

  \]

  The solutions are \( u = 1 \) and \( u = -2 \). Since \( u = m^2 \), we discard
  \( u = -2 \) and take \( u = 1 \). Thus, \( m^2 = 1 \), so \( m = \pm 1 \).


  ---


  ### Step 2: Find the points of tangency

  For \( m = 1 \), the tangent line is:

  \[

  y = x + 2.

  \]

  Substitute this into the parabola \( y^2 = 8x \):

  \[

  (x + 2)^2 = 8x \implies x^2 + 4x + 4 = 8x \implies x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0.

  \]

  This simplifies to \( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \), so \( x = 2 \). Substituting back into \(
  y = x + 2 \), we get \( y = 4 \). Thus, one point of tangency is \( (2, 4) \).


  For \( m = -1 \), the tangent line is:

  \[

  y = -x - 2.

  \]

  Substitute this into the parabola \( y^2 = 8x \):

  \[

  (-x - 2)^2 = 8x \implies x^2 + 4x + 4 = 8x \implies x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0.

  \]

  This simplifies to \( (x - 2)^2 = 0 \), so \( x = 2 \). Substituting back into \(
  y = -x - 2 \), we get \( y = -4 \). Thus, another point of tangency is \( (2, -4)
  \).


  Similarly, the other two points of tangency are \( (-1, 1) \) and \( (-1, -1) \),
  which can be verified by substituting into the circle and parabola equations.


  ---


  ### Step 3: Compute the area of the quadrilateral

  The four points of tangency are \( (2, 4) \), \( (2, -4) \), \( (-1, 1) \), and
  \( (-1, -1) \). These points form a quadrilateral. To find its area, we can use
  the shoelace formula.


  The shoelace formula for the area of a quadrilateral with vertices \( (x_1, y_1)
  \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), \( (x_3, y_3) \), and \( (x_4, y_4) \) is:

  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3
  + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1) \right|.

  \]


  Substituting the points \( (2, 4) \), \( (2, -4) \), \( (-1, -1) \), and \( (-1,
  1) \):

  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2(-4) + 2(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(4) - (4(2) + (-4)(-1)
  + (-1)(-1) + 1(2)) \right|.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| -8 - 2 - 1 - 4 - (8 + 4 + 1 + 2) \right| = \frac{1}{2}
  \left| -15 - 15 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 = 15.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
