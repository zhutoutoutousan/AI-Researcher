answer: "To determine the degree of the polynomial \\( p(x) \\), let's analyze each\
  \ term in the expression:\n\n\\[\np(x) = \\frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)}\
  \ + \\frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \\frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c -\
  \ b)}.\n\\]\n\n1. **Degree of each term**:\n   - Each term in the expression is\
  \ of the form \\(\\frac{(x - \\text{one root})(x - \\text{another root})}{\\text{constant}}\\\
  ). \n   - The numerator \\((x - b)(x - c)\\), \\((x - a)(x - c)\\), and \\((x -\
  \ a)(x - b)\\) are all quadratic polynomials (degree 2).\n   - The denominators\
  \ \\((a - b)(a - c)\\), \\((b - a)(b - c)\\), and \\((c - a)(c - b)\\) are constants\
  \ (degree 0).\n\n2. **Combining the terms**:\n   - Since each term is a quadratic\
  \ polynomial divided by a constant, each term remains a quadratic polynomial (degree\
  \ 2).\n   - When we add three quadratic polynomials together, the result is typically\
  \ a quadratic polynomial (degree 2), unless there is cancellation of the leading\
  \ terms.\n\n3. **Checking for cancellation**:\n   - Notice that \\( p(x) \\) is\
  \ actually the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for the points \\((a, 1)\\), \\\
  ((b, 1)\\), and \\((c, 1)\\). \n   - This means \\( p(a) = 1 \\), \\( p(b) = 1 \\\
  ), and \\( p(c) = 1 \\). \n   - Since \\( p(x) \\) takes the same value at three\
  \ distinct points, it must be a constant polynomial (degree 0).\n\nHowever, let's\
  \ verify this by expanding \\( p(x) \\):\n\n\\[\np(x) = \\frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a\
  \ - b)(a - c)} + \\frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \\frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c\
  \ - a)(c - b)}.\n\\]\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a -\
  \ b)(a - c)} = \\frac{x^2 - (b + c)x + bc}{(a - b)(a - c)},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{(x\
  \ - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} = \\frac{x^2 - (a + c)x + ac}{(b - a)(b - c)},\n\\\
  ]\n\\[\n\\frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = \\frac{x^2 - (a + b)x + ab}{(c\
  \ - a)(c - b)}.\n\\]\n\nWhen we add these three terms, the coefficients of \\( x^2\
  \ \\) cancel out, and the coefficients of \\( x \\) and the constant terms also\
  \ cancel out, leaving:\n\n\\[\np(x) = 1.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\( p(x) \\) is a constant\
  \ polynomial, and its degree is 0.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $0$. I hope\
  \ it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
