answer: 'To solve the equation:


  \[

  \sqrt{x + \sqrt{3x + 6}} + \sqrt{x - \sqrt{3x + 6}} = 6,

  \]


  we proceed step by step.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Let \( y = \sqrt{3x + 6} \)

  Let \( y = \sqrt{3x + 6} \). Then \( y^2 = 3x + 6 \), and we can rewrite the equation
  as:


  \[

  \sqrt{x + y} + \sqrt{x - y} = 6.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Square both sides

  Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots:


  \[

  \left(\sqrt{x + y} + \sqrt{x - y}\right)^2 = 6^2.

  \]


  Expand the left-hand side:


  \[

  (x + y) + (x - y) + 2\sqrt{(x + y)(x - y)} = 36.

  \]


  Simplify:


  \[

  2x + 2\sqrt{x^2 - y^2} = 36.

  \]


  Divide through by 2:


  \[

  x + \sqrt{x^2 - y^2} = 18.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Substitute \( y^2 = 3x + 6 \)

  From \( y^2 = 3x + 6 \), substitute into the equation:


  \[

  x + \sqrt{x^2 - (3x + 6)} = 18.

  \]


  Simplify the expression under the square root:


  \[

  x + \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 18.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Isolate the square root

  Subtract \( x \) from both sides:


  \[

  \sqrt{x^2 - 3x - 6} = 18 - x.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 5: Square both sides again

  Square both sides to eliminate the square root:


  \[

  x^2 - 3x - 6 = (18 - x)^2.

  \]


  Expand the right-hand side:


  \[

  x^2 - 3x - 6 = 324 - 36x + x^2.

  \]


  Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:


  \[

  -3x - 6 = 324 - 36x.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)

  Add \( 36x \) to both sides:


  \[

  33x - 6 = 324.

  \]


  Add 6 to both sides:


  \[

  33x = 330.

  \]


  Divide by 33:


  \[

  x = 10.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 7: Verify the solution

  Substitute \( x = 10 \) into the original equation to verify:


  \[

  \sqrt{10 + \sqrt{3(10) + 6}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{3(10) + 6}} = 6.

  \]


  Simplify:


  \[

  \sqrt{10 + \sqrt{36}} + \sqrt{10 - \sqrt{36}} = 6.

  \]


  \[

  \sqrt{10 + 6} + \sqrt{10 - 6} = 6.

  \]


  \[

  \sqrt{16} + \sqrt{4} = 6.

  \]


  \[

  4 + 2 = 6.

  \]


  The solution is valid.

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
