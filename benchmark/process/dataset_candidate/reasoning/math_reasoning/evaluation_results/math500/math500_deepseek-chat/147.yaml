answer: "To find the minimum value of \\( x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \\) given \\( xyz = 2\
  \ \\), we can use the **Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality**. Here's\
  \ the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Apply AM-GM to the terms \\( x^4 \\), \\(\
  \ 4y^2 \\), and \\( 4z^4 \\):**\n   \\[\n   x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{x^4\
  \ \\cdot 4y^2 \\cdot 4z^4}.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right-hand side:\n   \\\
  [\n   x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{16x^4 y^2 z^4}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute\
  \ \\( xyz = 2 \\) into the expression:**\n   Since \\( xyz = 2 \\), we can write\
  \ \\( y = \\frac{2}{xz} \\). Substitute this into the expression:\n   \\[\n   x^4\
  \ + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{16x^4 \\left(\\frac{2}{xz}\\right)^2 z^4}.\n \
  \  \\]\n   Simplify the expression inside the cube root:\n   \\[\n   x^4 + 4y^2\
  \ + 4z^4 \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{16x^4 \\cdot \\frac{4}{x^2 z^2} \\cdot z^4}.\n   \\]\n\
  \   Further simplification:\n   \\[\n   x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{64x^2\
  \ z^2}.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( x^2 z^2 = (xz)^2 \\), and \\( xz = \\frac{2}{y} \\\
  ), we have:\n   \\[\n   x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{64 \\cdot \\left(\\\
  frac{2}{y}\\right)^2}.\n   \\]\n   Simplify further:\n   \\[\n   x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4\
  \ \\geq 3 \\sqrt[3]{256/y^2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the minimum value:**\n   The\
  \ minimum value occurs when equality holds in the AM-GM inequality. This happens\
  \ when \\( x^4 = 4y^2 = 4z^4 \\). Let \\( x^4 = 4y^2 = 4z^4 = k \\). Then:\n   \\\
  [\n   x = k^{1/4}, \\quad y = \\sqrt{k/4}, \\quad z = k^{1/4}.\n   \\]\n   Substitute\
  \ these into \\( xyz = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   k^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{k/4} \\cdot k^{1/4}\
  \ = 2.\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n   \\[\n   k^{1/4} \\cdot k^{1/4} \\cdot \\sqrt{k/4}\
  \ = k^{1/2} \\cdot \\sqrt{k/4} = 2.\n   \\]\n   Further simplification:\n   \\[\n\
  \   k^{1/2} \\cdot \\frac{k^{1/2}}{2} = \\frac{k}{2} = 2.\n   \\]\n   Solving for\
  \ \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   k = 4.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the minimum value of \\(\
  \ x^4 + 4y^2 + 4z^4 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   3 \\sqrt[3]{16 \\cdot 4} = 3 \\sqrt[3]{64}\
  \ = 3 \\cdot 4 = 12.\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\( 12 \\). I\
  \ hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
