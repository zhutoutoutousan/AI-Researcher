answer: "To find the eighth term of the geometric sequence \\(\\frac{125}{9}, \\frac{25}{3},\
  \ 5, 3, \\ldots\\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the first term (\\(a_1\\\
  )) and the common ratio (\\(r\\)):**\n   - The first term is \\(a_1 = \\frac{125}{9}\\\
  ).\n   - The common ratio \\(r\\) is found by dividing the second term by the first\
  \ term:\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{\\frac{25}{3}}{\\frac{125}{9}} = \\frac{25}{3}\
  \ \\cdot \\frac{9}{125} = \\frac{225}{375} = \\frac{3}{5}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Use\
  \ the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of a geometric sequence:**\n   The \\(n\\\
  )-th term of a geometric sequence is given by:\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1}.\n\
  \   \\]\n   For the eighth term (\\(n = 8\\)):\n   \\[\n   a_8 = \\frac{125}{9}\
  \ \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{7}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify \\(\\left(\\\
  frac{3}{5}\\right)^{7}\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^{7} = \\frac{3^7}{5^7}\
  \ = \\frac{2187}{78125}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply to find \\(a_8\\):**\n   \\[\n\
  \   a_8 = \\frac{125}{9} \\cdot \\frac{2187}{78125} = \\frac{125 \\cdot 2187}{9\
  \ \\cdot 78125}.\n   \\]\n   Simplify the numerator and denominator:\n   \\[\n \
  \  125 \\cdot 2187 = 273375, \\quad 9 \\cdot 78125 = 703125.\n   \\]\n   So,\n \
  \  \\[\n   a_8 = \\frac{273375}{703125}.\n   \\]\n   Simplify the fraction by dividing\
  \ numerator and denominator by 273375:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{273375 \\div 273375}{703125\
  \ \\div 273375} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{703125}{273375}} = \\frac{1}{2.572} \\approx\
  \ \\frac{1}{\\frac{2572}{1000}} = \\frac{1000}{2572}.\n   \\]\n   However, we can\
  \ simplify \\(\\frac{273375}{703125}\\) directly by dividing numerator and denominator\
  \ by 1125:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{273375 \\div 1125}{703125 \\div 1125} = \\frac{243}{625}.\n\
  \   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   The eighth term of the sequence is \\(\\frac{243}{625}\\\
  ).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{243}{625}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
