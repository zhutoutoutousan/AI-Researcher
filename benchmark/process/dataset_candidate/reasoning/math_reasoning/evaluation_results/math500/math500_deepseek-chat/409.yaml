answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to find the distance between the foci of the
  hyperbola. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Identify the center of the hyperbola

  The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given by:

  \[

  y = 2x - 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = 17 - 2x.

  \]

  The center of the hyperbola is the point of intersection of the asymptotes. To find
  the center, solve the system of equations:

  \[

  2x - 3 = 17 - 2x.

  \]

  Add \(2x\) to both sides:

  \[

  4x - 3 = 17.

  \]

  Add \(3\) to both sides:

  \[

  4x = 20.

  \]

  Divide by \(4\):

  \[

  x = 5.

  \]

  Substitute \(x = 5\) into \(y = 2x - 3\):

  \[

  y = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

  \]

  Thus, the center of the hyperbola is \((5, 7)\).


  ---


  ### Step 2: Determine the slopes of the asymptotes

  The slopes of the asymptotes are \(2\) and \(-2\). For a hyperbola of the form:

  \[

  \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1,

  \]

  the slopes of the asymptotes are \(\pm \frac{b}{a}\). Here, \(\frac{b}{a} = 2\),
  so \(b = 2a\).


  ---


  ### Step 3: Use the point \((4, 7)\) to find \(a\) and \(b\)

  The hyperbola passes through \((4, 7)\). Substitute \((x, y) = (4, 7)\) and \((h,
  k) = (5, 7)\) into the hyperbola equation:

  \[

  \frac{(4-5)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(7-7)^2}{b^2} = 1.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  \frac{1}{a^2} - 0 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a
  = 1.

  \]

  Since \(b = 2a\), we have \(b = 2\).


  ---


  ### Step 4: Find \(c\) and the distance between the foci

  For a hyperbola, the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (the distance
  from the center to each focus) is:

  \[

  c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

  \]

  Substitute \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2\):

  \[

  c^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = \sqrt{5}.

  \]

  The distance between the foci is \(2c\):

  \[

  2c = 2\sqrt{5}.

  \]

gt_answer: 2 \sqrt{5}
prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
