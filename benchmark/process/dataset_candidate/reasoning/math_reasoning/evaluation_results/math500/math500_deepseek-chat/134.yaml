answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to find the equation of the hyperbola defined
  by the given condition and then determine the values of \( h \), \( k \), \( a \),
  and \( b \) to compute \( h + k + a + b \).


  ### Step 1: Identify the foci and the condition

  The foci of the hyperbola are given as \( F_1 = (10, 2) \) and \( F_2 = (-16, 2)
  \). The condition for the hyperbola is:

  \[

  |PF_1 - PF_2| = 24.

  \]

  This means the absolute difference of the distances from any point \( P \) on the
  hyperbola to the two foci is 24.


  ### Step 2: Determine the center of the hyperbola

  The center \( (h, k) \) of the hyperbola is the midpoint of the line segment connecting
  the two foci. Using the midpoint formula:

  \[

  h = \frac{10 + (-16)}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3,

  \]

  \[

  k = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2.

  \]

  Thus, the center is \( (-3, 2) \).


  ### Step 3: Calculate the distance between the foci

  The distance between the foci \( 2c \) is:

  \[

  2c = \sqrt{(10 - (-16))^2 + (2 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{26^2} = 26.

  \]

  So, \( c = 13 \).


  ### Step 4: Relate \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) for a hyperbola

  For a hyperbola, the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) is:

  \[

  c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

  \]

  We know \( c = 13 \), and from the condition \( |PF_1 - PF_2| = 24 \), we have \(
  2a = 24 \), so \( a = 12 \).


  Now, solve for \( b \):

  \[

  b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 13^2 - 12^2 = 169 - 144 = 25.

  \]

  Thus, \( b = 5 \).


  ### Step 5: Compute \( h + k + a + b \)

  Now, substitute the values of \( h \), \( k \), \( a \), and \( b \):

  \[

  h + k + a + b = -3 + 2 + 12 + 5 = 16.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(16\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
