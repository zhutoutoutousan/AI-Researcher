answer: 'To determine \( f(2015, 2) \), we will analyze the recursive function definition
  step by step.


  ### Step 1: Understand the Base Cases

  The function \( f(i, j) \) is defined recursively with the following base cases:

  1. If \( i = 0 \) and \( 0 \leq j \leq 4 \), then \( f(i, j) = \text{mod}_5(j +
  1) \).

  2. If \( i \geq 1 \) and \( j = 0 \), then \( f(i, j) = f(i-1, 1) \).

  3. If \( i \geq 1 \) and \( 1 \leq j \leq 4 \), then \( f(i, j) = f(i-1, f(i, j-1))
  \).


  ### Step 2: Compute \( f(0, j) \) for \( j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \)

  Using the first case:

  - \( f(0, 0) = \text{mod}_5(0 + 1) = 1 \).

  - \( f(0, 1) = \text{mod}_5(1 + 1) = 2 \).

  - \( f(0, 2) = \text{mod}_5(2 + 1) = 3 \).

  - \( f(0, 3) = \text{mod}_5(3 + 1) = 4 \).

  - \( f(0, 4) = \text{mod}_5(4 + 1) = 0 \).


  ### Step 3: Compute \( f(1, j) \) for \( j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \)

  Using the second and third cases:

  - \( f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) = 2 \).

  - \( f(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0)) = f(0, 2) = 3 \).

  - \( f(1, 2) = f(0, f(1, 1)) = f(0, 3) = 4 \).

  - \( f(1, 3) = f(0, f(1, 2)) = f(0, 4) = 0 \).

  - \( f(1, 4) = f(0, f(1, 3)) = f(0, 0) = 1 \).


  ### Step 4: Compute \( f(2, j) \) for \( j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \)

  Using the second and third cases:

  - \( f(2, 0) = f(1, 1) = 3 \).

  - \( f(2, 1) = f(1, f(2, 0)) = f(1, 3) = 0 \).

  - \( f(2, 2) = f(1, f(2, 1)) = f(1, 0) = 2 \).

  - \( f(2, 3) = f(1, f(2, 2)) = f(1, 2) = 4 \).

  - \( f(2, 4) = f(1, f(2, 3)) = f(1, 4) = 1 \).


  ### Step 5: Observe the Pattern

  From the computations above, we observe that \( f(i, j) \) cycles every 5 steps
  in \( i \). Specifically:

  - \( f(i, 2) \) cycles through the values \( 3, 4, 2, 0, 1 \) as \( i \) increases.


  ### Step 6: Compute \( f(2015, 2) \)

  Since the cycle length is 5, we can find the remainder when 2015 is divided by 5:

  - \( 2015 \mod 5 = 0 \).


  Thus, \( f(2015, 2) \) corresponds to the value in the cycle when \( i \mod 5 =
  0 \), which is \( 3 \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 3 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
