answer: "To determine the shape described by the equation \\( z = c \\) in cylindrical\
  \ coordinates \\((r, \\theta, z)\\), let's analyze the equation step by step.\n\n\
  1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \\( z = c \\) means that the \\\
  ( z \\)-coordinate is constant for all points that satisfy this equation. This implies\
  \ that no matter what values \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\) take, \\( z \\) remains\
  \ fixed at \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Visualizing the Shape**: In three-dimensional space,\
  \ fixing \\( z \\) at a constant value \\( c \\) describes a plane that is parallel\
  \ to the \\( xy \\)-plane and located at height \\( z = c \\). This plane extends\
  \ infinitely in the \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) directions.\n\n3. **Eliminating Other\
  \ Options**:\n   - (A) **Line**: A line would require a relationship between \\\
  ( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\), not just a fixed \\( z \\).\n   - (B) **Circle**:\
  \ A circle would require a relationship involving \\( r \\) and \\( \\theta \\),\
  \ not just a fixed \\( z \\).\n   - (C) **Plane**: This matches our analysis, as\
  \ \\( z = c \\) describes a plane.\n   - (D) **Sphere**: A sphere would require\
  \ an equation involving \\( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\), not just a fixed \\( z \\).\n \
  \  - (E) **Cylinder**: A cylinder would require an equation involving \\( r \\)\
  \ (e.g., \\( r = \\text{constant} \\)), not just a fixed \\( z \\).\n   - (F) **Cone**:\
  \ A cone would require an equation involving \\( z \\) and \\( r \\) (e.g., \\(\
  \ z = kr \\)), not just a fixed \\( z \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The equation \\\
  ( z = c \\) describes a plane.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (C). I hope\
  \ it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
