answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n \
  \  - Let \\(\\triangle = T\\)\n   - Let \\(\\square = S\\)\n   - Let \\(\\diamond\
  \ = D\\)\n   - Let \\(\\clubsuit = C\\)\n\n2. **Translate the equations:**\n   -\
  \ From the first equation: \\(T + S = C\\).\n   - From the second equation: \\(T\
  \ + T = D + D + D + D + D\\), which simplifies to \\(2T = 5D\\).\n   - From the\
  \ third equation: \\(T + T = C + D\\), which simplifies to \\(2T = C + D\\).\n\n\
  3. **Substitute \\(C\\) from the first equation into the third equation:**\n   -\
  \ From the first equation, \\(C = T + S\\).\n   - Substitute into the third equation:\
  \ \\(2T = (T + S) + D\\).\n   - Simplify: \\(2T = T + S + D\\).\n   - Subtract \\\
  (T\\) from both sides: \\(T = S + D\\).\n\n4. **Use the second equation \\(2T =\
  \ 5D\\) to express \\(T\\) in terms of \\(D\\):**\n   - \\(T = \\frac{5D}{2}\\).\n\
  \n5. **Substitute \\(T = \\frac{5D}{2}\\) into \\(T = S + D\\):**\n   - \\(\\frac{5D}{2}\
  \ = S + D\\).\n   - Subtract \\(D\\) from both sides: \\(\\frac{5D}{2} - D = S\\\
  ).\n   - Simplify: \\(\\frac{5D - 2D}{2} = S\\), so \\(\\frac{3D}{2} = S\\).\n\n\
  6. **Determine possible integer values for \\(D\\):**\n   - Since \\(S\\) must be\
  \ an integer between 1 and 9, \\(\\frac{3D}{2}\\) must also be an integer.\n   -\
  \ This implies \\(D\\) must be even.\n   - Possible values for \\(D\\) are 2, 4,\
  \ 6, or 8.\n\n7. **Test possible values for \\(D\\):**\n   - If \\(D = 2\\):\n \
  \    - \\(T = \\frac{5 \\cdot 2}{2} = 5\\).\n     - \\(S = \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{2}\
  \ = 3\\).\n     - \\(C = T + S = 5 + 3 = 8\\).\n     - All values are distinct and\
  \ within the range 1 to 9.\n\n   - If \\(D = 4\\):\n     - \\(T = \\frac{5 \\cdot\
  \ 4}{2} = 10\\), which is outside the range 1 to 9. This is invalid.\n\n   - If\
  \ \\(D = 6\\):\n     - \\(T = \\frac{5 \\cdot 6}{2} = 15\\), which is outside the\
  \ range 1 to 9. This is invalid.\n\n   - If \\(D = 8\\):\n     - \\(T = \\frac{5\
  \ \\cdot 8}{2} = 20\\), which is outside the range 1 to 9. This is invalid.\n\n\
  8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only valid solution is \\(D = 2\\), \\(T = 5\\), \\\
  (S = 3\\), and \\(C = 8\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(3\\). I hope\
  \ it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
