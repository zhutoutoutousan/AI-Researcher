answer: "To solve the equation \\( |x + 5| - |3x - 6| = 0 \\), we need to consider\
  \ the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change their\
  \ behavior. These critical points are \\( x = -5 \\) (from \\( x + 5 = 0 \\)) and\
  \ \\( x = 2 \\) (from \\( 3x - 6 = 0 \\)).\n\nWe will analyze the equation in three\
  \ intervals:\n\n1. **Interval 1: \\( x < -5 \\)**\n   - \\( x + 5 < 0 \\) so \\\
  ( |x + 5| = -(x + 5) \\).\n   - \\( 3x - 6 < 0 \\) so \\( |3x - 6| = -(3x - 6) \\\
  ).\n   - The equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     -(x + 5) - (-(3x - 6)) = 0 \\implies\
  \ -x - 5 + 3x - 6 = 0 \\implies 2x - 11 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{11}{2}.\n     \\\
  ]\n   - However, \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} \\) is not in the interval \\( x < -5 \\\
  ), so there is no solution in this interval.\n\n2. **Interval 2: \\( -5 \\leq x\
  \ < 2 \\)**\n   - \\( x + 5 \\geq 0 \\) so \\( |x + 5| = x + 5 \\).\n   - \\( 3x\
  \ - 6 < 0 \\) so \\( |3x - 6| = -(3x - 6) \\).\n   - The equation becomes:\n   \
  \  \\[\n     x + 5 - (-(3x - 6)) = 0 \\implies x + 5 + 3x - 6 = 0 \\implies 4x -\
  \ 1 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{4}.\n     \\]\n   - \\( x = \\frac{1}{4} \\) is\
  \ within the interval \\( -5 \\leq x < 2 \\), so it is a valid solution.\n\n3. **Interval\
  \ 3: \\( x \\geq 2 \\)**\n   - \\( x + 5 \\geq 0 \\) so \\( |x + 5| = x + 5 \\).\n\
  \   - \\( 3x - 6 \\geq 0 \\) so \\( |3x - 6| = 3x - 6 \\).\n   - The equation becomes:\n\
  \     \\[\n     x + 5 - (3x - 6) = 0 \\implies x + 5 - 3x + 6 = 0 \\implies -2x\
  \ + 11 = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{11}{2}.\n     \\]\n   - \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} \\\
  ) is within the interval \\( x \\geq 2 \\), so it is a valid solution.\n\nThe solutions\
  \ are \\( x = \\frac{1}{4} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} \\). The largest possible\
  \ value of \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{11}{2} \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(\\frac{11}{2}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
