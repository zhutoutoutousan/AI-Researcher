answer: 'To determine the area of the set \( S \) of points \((a, b)\) such that the
  equation

  \[

  x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1 = 0

  \]

  has at least one real root, we proceed as follows:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Analyze the equation

  The given equation is a quartic polynomial:

  \[

  x^4 + a x^3 - b x^2 + a x + 1 = 0.

  \]

  We want to find the conditions on \( a \) and \( b \) such that this equation has
  at least one real root.


  ---


  ### Step 2: Substitute \( x = -1 \)

  Let \( x = -1 \). Substituting into the equation:

  \[

  (-1)^4 + a(-1)^3 - b(-1)^2 + a(-1) + 1 = 1 - a - b - a + 1 = 2 - 2a - b.

  \]

  For \( x = -1 \) to be a root, we require:

  \[

  2 - 2a - b = 0 \implies b = 2 - 2a.

  \]

  This is a line in the \( (a, b) \)-plane.


  ---


  ### Step 3: Substitute \( x = 1 \)

  Let \( x = 1 \). Substituting into the equation:

  \[

  1^4 + a(1)^3 - b(1)^2 + a(1) + 1 = 1 + a - b + a + 1 = 2 + 2a - b.

  \]

  For \( x = 1 \) to be a root, we require:

  \[

  2 + 2a - b = 0 \implies b = 2 + 2a.

  \]

  This is another line in the \( (a, b) \)-plane.


  ---


  ### Step 4: Determine the region \( S \)

  The set \( S \) consists of all points \((a, b)\) in the unit square \( 0 \le a
  \le 1 \), \( 0 \le b \le 1 \) such that the equation has at least one real root.
  From the above analysis, the boundary of \( S \) is given by the lines:

  \[

  b = 2 - 2a \quad \text{and} \quad b = 2 + 2a.

  \]

  However, since \( 0 \le a \le 1 \) and \( 0 \le b \le 1 \), the line \( b = 2 +
  2a \) does not intersect the unit square. The line \( b = 2 - 2a \) intersects the
  unit square at \( a = 0.5 \), \( b = 1 \).


  Thus, the region \( S \) is the area below the line \( b = 2 - 2a \) within the
  unit square. This is a triangle with vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((0.5, 1)\), and \((1,
  0)\).


  ---


  ### Step 5: Calculate the area of \( S \)

  The area of the triangle is:

  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}.

  \]

  Here, the base is \( 1 \) (from \( a = 0 \) to \( a = 1 \)), and the height is \(
  1 \) (from \( b = 0 \) to \( b = 1 \)). Thus:

  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2}.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
