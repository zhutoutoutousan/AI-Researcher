answer: "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the function \\( F(z) = \\frac{z\
  \ + i}{z - i} \\) and its iterates. We are given \\( z_0 = \\frac{1}{137} + i \\\
  ), and we need to find \\( z_{2002} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Compute \\( z_1 = F(z_0)\
  \ \\)\nFirst, substitute \\( z_0 = \\frac{1}{137} + i \\) into \\( F(z) \\):\n\\\
  [\nz_1 = F(z_0) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{137} + i\\right) + i}{\\left(\\frac{1}{137}\
  \ + i\\right) - i} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{137} + 2i}{\\frac{1}{137}} = 1 + 274i.\n\\\
  ]\n\n### Step 2: Compute \\( z_2 = F(z_1) \\)\nNow substitute \\( z_1 = 1 + 274i\
  \ \\) into \\( F(z) \\):\n\\[\nz_2 = F(z_1) = \\frac{(1 + 274i) + i}{(1 + 274i)\
  \ - i} = \\frac{1 + 275i}{1 + 273i}.\n\\]\nTo simplify this, multiply the numerator\
  \ and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:\n\\[\nz_2 = \\frac{(1 + 275i)(1\
  \ - 273i)}{(1 + 273i)(1 - 273i)} = \\frac{1 - 273i + 275i - 273 \\cdot 275i^2}{1\
  \ - (273i)^2}.\n\\]\nSince \\( i^2 = -1 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[\nz_2 = \\\
  frac{1 + 2i + 273 \\cdot 275}{1 + 273^2}.\n\\]\nHowever, this calculation is unnecessary\
  \ because we can observe a pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Observe the Pattern\nNotice that\
  \ \\( F(z) \\) is a M\xF6bius transformation, and its iterates will cycle through\
  \ a finite set of values. Specifically, \\( F(F(z)) = z \\) for any \\( z \\neq\
  \ i \\). This means that \\( z_2 = z_0 \\), and the sequence \\( z_n \\) will alternate\
  \ between \\( z_0 \\) and \\( z_1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine \\( z_{2002} \\\
  )\nSince the sequence alternates between \\( z_0 \\) and \\( z_1 \\), and \\( 2002\
  \ \\) is even, we have:\n\\[\nz_{2002} = z_0 = \\frac{1}{137} + i.\n\\]\n\nFinal\
  \ Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{1}{137} + i\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
