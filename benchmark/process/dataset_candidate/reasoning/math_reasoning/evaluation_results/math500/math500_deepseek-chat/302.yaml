answer: 'To determine the number of repeating digits in the decimal representation
  of \(\frac{31}{11111}\), we can use the concept of the **order** of 10 modulo the
  denominator. Specifically, the number of repeating digits in the decimal expansion
  of \(\frac{a}{b}\) (where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime) is equal to the smallest
  positive integer \(k\) such that \(10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{b}\).


  ### Step 1: Check if 31 and 11111 are coprime

  First, we check if 31 and 11111 share any common divisors. Since 31 is a prime number
  and 11111 is not divisible by 31 (because \(11111 \div 31 \approx 358.42\), which
  is not an integer), they are coprime.


  ### Step 2: Find the smallest \(k\) such that \(10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{11111}\)

  We need to find the smallest positive integer \(k\) such that \(10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{11111}\).
  This \(k\) is known as the **multiplicative order** of 10 modulo 11111.


  To find this, we can test successive powers of 10 modulo 11111:

  - \(10^1 \equiv 10 \pmod{11111}\)

  - \(10^2 \equiv 100 \pmod{11111}\)

  - \(10^3 \equiv 1000 \pmod{11111}\)

  - \(10^4 \equiv 10000 \pmod{11111}\)

  - \(10^5 \equiv 100000 \equiv 100000 - 9 \cdot 11111 = 100000 - 99999 = 1 \pmod{11111}\)


  Thus, \(10^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{11111}\), and the smallest such \(k\) is 5.


  ### Step 3: Conclusion

  The decimal representation of \(\frac{31}{11111}\) has a repeating block of **5
  digits**.

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
