answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n \
  \  - Let \\( C_p \\) be the cost per square inch of paint (proportional to surface\
  \ area).\n   - Let \\( C_c \\) be the cost per cubic inch of concrete (proportional\
  \ to volume).\n\n2. **Express the total cost for a cube of side length \\( s \\\
  ):**\n   - The surface area of a cube is \\( 6s^2 \\), so the cost of paint is \\\
  ( 6s^2 \\cdot C_p \\).\n   - The volume of a cube is \\( s^3 \\), so the cost of\
  \ concrete is \\( s^3 \\cdot C_c \\).\n   - The total cost is:\n     \\[\n     \\\
  text{Total Cost} = 6s^2 \\cdot C_p + s^3 \\cdot C_c.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set up equations\
  \ using the given information:**\n   - For a 1-inch cube (\\( s = 1 \\)):\n    \
  \ \\[\n     6(1)^2 \\cdot C_p + (1)^3 \\cdot C_c = 1.30 \\implies 6C_p + C_c = 1.30.\
  \ \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n   - For a 2-inch cube (\\( s = 2 \\)):\n\
  \     \\[\n     6(2)^2 \\cdot C_p + (2)^3 \\cdot C_c = 6.80 \\implies 24C_p + 8C_c\
  \ = 6.80. \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve the system of equations:**\n\
  \   - From Equation 1, solve for \\( C_c \\):\n     \\[\n     C_c = 1.30 - 6C_p.\n\
  \     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( C_c \\) into Equation 2:\n     \\[\n     24C_p +\
  \ 8(1.30 - 6C_p) = 6.80.\n     \\]\n     Simplify:\n     \\[\n     24C_p + 10.40\
  \ - 48C_p = 6.80 \\implies -24C_p = -3.60 \\implies C_p = 0.15.\n     \\]\n   -\
  \ Substitute \\( C_p = 0.15 \\) back into Equation 1 to find \\( C_c \\):\n    \
  \ \\[\n     C_c = 1.30 - 6(0.15) = 1.30 - 0.90 = 0.40.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate\
  \ the cost for a 3-inch cube (\\( s = 3 \\)):**\n   - The total cost is:\n     \\\
  [\n     \\text{Total Cost} = 6(3)^2 \\cdot 0.15 + (3)^3 \\cdot 0.40.\n     \\]\n\
  \     Simplify:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Cost} = 6 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 0.15 + 27\
  \ \\cdot 0.40 = 8.10 + 10.80 = 18.90.\n     \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\$18.90. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\

question: Fake gold bricks are made by covering concrete cubes with gold paint, so
  the cost of the paint is proportional to their surface area while the cost of the
  concrete is proportional to their volume.  If a 1 inch cube costs $\$1.30$ to make
  while a 2 inch cube costs $\$6.80$, then how much would a 3 inch cube cost?
