answer: 'To find the maximum value of the expression \( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \), we can
  proceed step by step.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Expand the expression

  First, expand the expression \( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \):


  \[

  4(x + 7)(2 - x) = 4[(x + 7)(2 - x)].

  \]


  Now expand \( (x + 7)(2 - x) \):


  \[

  (x + 7)(2 - x) = x \cdot 2 + x \cdot (-x) + 7 \cdot 2 + 7 \cdot (-x) = 2x - x^2
  + 14 - 7x.

  \]


  Combine like terms:


  \[

  2x - 7x - x^2 + 14 = -x^2 - 5x + 14.

  \]


  Now multiply by 4:


  \[

  4(-x^2 - 5x + 14) = -4x^2 - 20x + 56.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Rewrite as a quadratic function

  The expression \( -4x^2 - 20x + 56 \) is a quadratic function of the form \( f(x)
  = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = -4 \), \( b = -20 \), and \( c = 56 \).


  Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) (\( a = -4 \)) is negative, the parabola opens
  downward, and the function has a maximum value at its vertex.


  ---


  ### Step 3: Find the vertex of the parabola

  The \( x \)-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function \( f(x) = ax^2 + bx
  + c \) is given by:


  \[

  x = -\frac{b}{2a}.

  \]


  Substitute \( a = -4 \) and \( b = -20 \):


  \[

  x = -\frac{-20}{2(-4)} = \frac{20}{-8} = -\frac{5}{2}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Find the maximum value

  Substitute \( x = -\frac{5}{2} \) into the quadratic function \( f(x) = -4x^2 -
  20x + 56 \) to find the maximum value:


  \[

  f\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) = -4\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)^2 - 20\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right)
  + 56.

  \]


  Simplify:


  \[

  f\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) = -4\left(\frac{25}{4}\right) + 50 + 56 = -25 + 50 +
  56 = 81.

  \]

  ### Final Answer:

  The maximum value of \( 4(x + 7)(2 - x) \) is \( 81 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
