answer: 'To solve for \(\tan A\) given the area of triangle \(ABC\) as \(a^2 - (b
  - c)^2\), we proceed step by step.


  ### Step 1: Express the area in terms of sides and angles

  The area \(K\) of triangle \(ABC\) can be expressed using the formula:

  \[

  K = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A

  \]

  where \(b\) and \(c\) are the sides adjacent to angle \(A\), and \(\sin A\) is the
  sine of angle \(A\).


  ### Step 2: Expand the given area expression

  The given area is:

  \[

  K = a^2 - (b - c)^2

  \]

  Expanding the right-hand side:

  \[

  a^2 - (b - c)^2 = a^2 - (b^2 - 2bc + c^2) = a^2 - b^2 + 2bc - c^2

  \]


  ### Step 3: Relate \(a^2\) to the sides using the Law of Cosines

  From the Law of Cosines, we have:

  \[

  a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A

  \]

  Substitute this into the expanded area expression:

  \[

  K = (b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A) - b^2 + 2bc - c^2 = 2bc - 2bc \cos A

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  K = 2bc(1 - \cos A)

  \]


  ### Step 4: Equate the two expressions for the area

  From Step 1 and Step 3, we have:

  \[

  \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A = 2bc(1 - \cos A)

  \]

  Divide both sides by \(bc\) (since \(b\) and \(c\) are nonzero):

  \[

  \frac{1}{2} \sin A = 2(1 - \cos A)

  \]

  Multiply both sides by 2:

  \[

  \sin A = 4(1 - \cos A)

  \]


  ### Step 5: Express \(\tan A\) in terms of \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\)

  Recall that:

  \[

  \tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}

  \]

  From the equation \(\sin A = 4(1 - \cos A)\), we can solve for \(\sin A\) and \(\cos
  A\).


  ### Step 6: Solve for \(\cos A\)

  Using the identity \(\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1\), substitute \(\sin A = 4(1 - \cos
  A)\):

  \[

  [4(1 - \cos A)]^2 + \cos^2 A = 1

  \]

  Expand and simplify:

  \[

  16(1 - 2\cos A + \cos^2 A) + \cos^2 A = 1

  \]

  \[

  16 - 32\cos A + 16\cos^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1

  \]

  \[

  17\cos^2 A - 32\cos A + 16 = 1

  \]

  \[

  17\cos^2 A - 32\cos A + 15 = 0

  \]

  Solve this quadratic equation for \(\cos A\):

  \[

  \cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \cdot 17 \cdot 15}}{2 \cdot 17}

  \]

  \[

  \cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{1024 - 1020}}{34}

  \]

  \[

  \cos A = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{4}}{34}

  \]

  \[

  \cos A = \frac{32 \pm 2}{34}

  \]

  This gives two solutions:

  \[

  \cos A = \frac{34}{34} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad \cos A = \frac{30}{34} = \frac{15}{17}

  \]

  Since \(\cos A = 1\) would imply \(A = 0^\circ\), which is not possible for a triangle,
  we take:

  \[

  \cos A = \frac{15}{17}

  \]


  ### Step 7: Find \(\sin A\)

  Using \(\sin A = 4(1 - \cos A)\):

  \[

  \sin A = 4\left(1 - \frac{15}{17}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{2}{17} = \frac{8}{17}

  \]


  ### Step 8: Compute \(\tan A\)

  \[

  \tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = \frac{\frac{8}{17}}{\frac{15}{17}} = \frac{8}{15}

  \]
