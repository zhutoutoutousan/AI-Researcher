answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct ways to\
  \ seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering that\
  \ rotations of the same configuration are equivalent.\n\n### Step 1: Total arrangements\
  \ without considering rotations\nFirst, calculate the total number of ways to arrange\
  \ 8 people in a circle. For circular arrangements, the number of distinct arrangements\
  \ is \\((n-1)!\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of people. This is because one person's\
  \ position can be fixed to account for rotational symmetry.\n\nThus, the total number\
  \ of arrangements is:\n\\[\n(8-1)! = 7! = 5040\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Accounting for\
  \ rotational symmetry\nSince the table is square, there are 4 rotational symmetries\
  \ (0\xB0, 90\xB0, 180\xB0, and 270\xB0). This means that each unique arrangement\
  \ can appear in 4 different rotations, which are considered equivalent.\n\nTo find\
  \ the number of distinct arrangements, we divide the total number of arrangements\
  \ by the number of rotational symmetries:\n\\[\n\\frac{7!}{4} = \\frac{5040}{4}\
  \ = 1260\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Final answer\nTherefore, the number of distinct ways\
  \ to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on each side, considering\
  \ rotational symmetry, is 1260.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(1260\\).\
  \ I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
