answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of the digits in the terminating
  decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\).


  ### Step 1: Simplify the denominator

  The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). To make the fraction a terminating decimal,
  we need to ensure that the denominator is of the form \(2^a \cdot 5^b\). Here, the
  denominator already satisfies this condition.


  ### Step 2: Adjust the fraction to have a denominator of \(10^n\)

  To convert the fraction into a decimal, we want the denominator to be a power of
  10. The highest power of 10 we can form from \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\) is \(10^7\), since
  \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 = 10^7\). We have an extra \(2^1\) in the denominator, so we multiply
  both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^1\) to balance it:


  \[

  \frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321 \cdot 2}{5^7 \cdot 2^8 \cdot 2} = \frac{8642}{10^7}.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Write the fraction as a decimal

  Now, the fraction \(\frac{8642}{10^7}\) can be written as:


  \[

  0.0008642.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Sum the digits of the decimal

  The decimal representation is \(0.0008642\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 8, 6, 4,
  2\). Summing these digits gives:


  \[

  0 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 20.

  \]


  ### Final Answer:

  Final Answer: The final answer is \(20\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
