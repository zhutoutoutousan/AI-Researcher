answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:


  1. **Find the sum of the positive divisors of 500.**

  2. **Factorize the sum obtained in step 1 into its prime factors.**

  3. **Sum the distinct prime factors.**


  Let''s proceed step by step.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Find the sum of the positive divisors of 500.


  First, factorize \( 500 \) into its prime factors:

  \[

  500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3

  \]


  The sum of the divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{a_1} \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \dots
  \cdot p_k^{a_k} \) is given by:

  \[

  \text{Sum of divisors} = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{a_1}) \cdot (1 + p_2 +
  p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{a_2}) \cdot \dots \cdot (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \dots + p_k^{a_k})

  \]


  For \( 500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3 \), the sum of the divisors is:

  \[

  \text{Sum of divisors} = (1 + 2 + 2^2) \cdot (1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3)

  \]


  Calculate each part:

  \[

  1 + 2 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7

  \]

  \[

  1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 5 + 25 + 125 = 156

  \]


  Now multiply the two results:

  \[

  \text{Sum of divisors} = 7 \cdot 156 = 1092

  \]


  Thus, \( A = 1092 \).


  ---


  ### Step 2: Factorize \( A = 1092 \) into its prime factors.


  Factorize \( 1092 \):

  \[

  1092 = 2 \cdot 546

  \]

  \[

  546 = 2 \cdot 273

  \]

  \[

  273 = 3 \cdot 91

  \]

  \[

  91 = 7 \cdot 13

  \]


  So, the prime factorization of \( 1092 \) is:

  \[

  1092 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Sum the distinct prime divisors of \( A \).


  The distinct prime divisors of \( 1092 \) are \( 2, 3, 7, \) and \( 13 \). Sum them:

  \[

  2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25

  \]

  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 25 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
