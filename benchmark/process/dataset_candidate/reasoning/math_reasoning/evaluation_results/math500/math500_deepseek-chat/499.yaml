answer: "To find the measure of angle \\( \\angle AHB \\) in triangle \\( ABC \\),\
  \ we can use the properties of the orthocenter (the point where the altitudes intersect)\
  \ and the given angles.\n\n1. **Given Angles:**\n   - \\( \\angle BAC = 54^\\circ\
  \ \\)\n   - \\( \\angle ABC = 52^\\circ \\)\n\n2. **Find \\( \\angle ACB \\):**\n\
  \   Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is \\( 180^\\circ \\), we have:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - \\angle BAC - \\angle ABC = 180^\\circ -\
  \ 54^\\circ - 52^\\circ = 74^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Understanding the Orthocenter:**\n\
  \   The orthocenter \\( H \\) is the point where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.\
  \ In an acute triangle, the orthocenter lies inside the triangle.\n\n4. **Key Property:**\n\
  \   The measure of \\( \\angle AHB \\) is related to the angles of the triangle.\
  \ Specifically, in any triangle, the measure of the angle formed by two altitudes\
  \ (in this case, \\( \\angle AHB \\)) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\angle AHB = 180^\\\
  circ - \\angle ACB\n   \\]\n   This is because \\( \\angle AHB \\) and \\( \\angle\
  \ ACB \\) are supplementary angles in the quadrilateral formed by the altitudes.\n\
  \n5. **Calculate \\( \\angle AHB \\):**\n   Using the property above:\n   \\[\n\
  \   \\angle AHB = 180^\\circ - \\angle ACB = 180^\\circ - 74^\\circ = 106^\\circ\n\
  \   \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(106^\\circ\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
