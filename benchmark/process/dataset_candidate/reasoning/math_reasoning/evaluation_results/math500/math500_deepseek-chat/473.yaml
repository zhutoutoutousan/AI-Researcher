answer: 'To find the value of \( n \) in the magic square, we use the property that
  the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal must be equal. Let''s analyze
  the given magic square:


  \[

  \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

  \hline

  n-3 & n+2 & 2 \\

  \hline

  3 & 2n-9 & n \\

  \hline

  n+1 & 1 & n-1 \\

  \hline

  \end{array}

  \]


  ### Step 1: Compute the sum of the first row

  The first row consists of \( n-3 \), \( n+2 \), and \( 2 \). The sum of the first
  row is:

  \[

  (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Compute the sum of the second row

  The second row consists of \( 3 \), \( 2n-9 \), and \( n \). The sum of the second
  row is:

  \[

  3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Set the sums equal

  Since the sums of all rows must be equal, we set the sum of the first row equal
  to the sum of the second row:

  \[

  2n + 1 = 3n - 6.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Solve for \( n \)

  Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:

  \[

  1 = n - 6.

  \]

  Add \( 6 \) to both sides:

  \[

  n = 7.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Verify the solution

  Substitute \( n = 7 \) into the sums:

  - First row: \( 2(7) + 1 = 15 \).

  - Second row: \( 3(7) - 6 = 15 \).

  - Third row: \( (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \).


  The sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals are equal to \( 15 \), confirming that
  \( n = 7 \) is correct.


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 7 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
