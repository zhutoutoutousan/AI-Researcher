answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to consider all triples \((a, b, c)\) of positive
  integers that satisfy the triangle inequality conditions:


  \[

  a + b > c, \quad a + c > b, \quad b + c > a.

  \]


  Given the symmetry in the problem, we can assume without loss of generality that
  \(a \leq b \leq c\). Under this assumption, the triangle inequality reduces to:


  \[

  a + b > c.

  \]


  We now need to compute the sum:


  \[

  \sum_{(a,b,c) \in T} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c}.

  \]


  To evaluate this sum, we can use generating functions. Consider the following generating
  functions for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):


  - For \(a\), the generating function is \(\sum_{a=1}^{\infty} 2^a x^a = \frac{2x}{1
  - 2x}\).

  - For \(b\), the generating function is \(\sum_{b=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^b}{3^b} =
  \frac{x/3}{1 - x/3}\).

  - For \(c\), the generating function is \(\sum_{c=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^c}{5^c} =
  \frac{x/5}{1 - x/5}\).


  The condition \(a + b > c\) can be handled by considering the generating function
  for \(c\) with the constraint \(c < a + b\). The generating function for \(c\) under
  this constraint is:


  \[

  \sum_{c=1}^{a+b-1} \frac{x^c}{5^c} = \frac{x/5}{1 - x/5} \left(1 - \left(\frac{x}{5}\right)^{a+b}\right).

  \]


  Now, the total generating function for the sum is:


  \[

  \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \sum_{c=1}^{a+b-1} \frac{2^a}{3^b 5^c} x^{a+b+c}.

  \]


  This can be simplified by first summing over \(c\):


  \[

  \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \frac{2^a}{3^b} \cdot \frac{x^{a+b}}{5}
  \cdot \frac{1 - (x/5)^{a+b}}{1 - x/5}.

  \]


  Next, we sum over \(b\):


  \[

  \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} 2^a x^a \sum_{b=a}^{\infty} \left(\frac{x}{3}\right)^b \cdot
  \frac{1 - (x/5)^{a+b}}{1 - x/5}.

  \]


  This simplifies further to:


  \[

  \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} 2^a x^a \cdot \frac{(x/3)^a}{1 - x/3} \cdot \frac{1 - (x/5)^{2a}}{1
  - x/5}.

  \]


  Finally, summing over \(a\):


  \[

  \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{2x^2}{3}\right)^a \cdot \frac{1 - (x^2/15)^a}{1
  - x/5}.

  \]


  This can be evaluated as:


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 - x/5} \left( \sum_{a=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{2x^2}{3}\right)^a - \sum_{a=1}^{\infty}
  \left(\frac{2x^4}{45}\right)^a \right).

  \]


  The sums are geometric series:


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 - x/5} \left( \frac{2x^2/3}{1 - 2x^2/3} - \frac{2x^4/45}{1 - 2x^4/45}
  \right).

  \]


  Simplifying further:


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 - x/5} \left( \frac{2x^2/3}{1 - 2x^2/3} - \frac{2x^4/45}{1 - 2x^4/45}
  \right).

  \]


  To find the sum, we set \(x = 1\):


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 - 1/5} \left( \frac{2/3}{1 - 2/3} - \frac{2/45}{1 - 2/45} \right) = \frac{5}{4}
  \left( \frac{2/3}{1/3} - \frac{2/45}{43/45} \right) = \frac{5}{4} \left( 2 - \frac{2}{43}
  \right) = \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{84}{43} = \frac{105}{43}.

  \]


  Thus, the sum is:


  \[

  \boxed{\frac{105}{43}}.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is $\frac{105}{43}$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
