answer: "To find the smallest possible value of \\(\\left| m - n \\right|\\) given\
  \ the equation \\(3m + 4n = 100\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Express \\\
  (m\\) in terms of \\(n\\):**\n   \\[\n   3m + 4n = 100 \\implies 3m = 100 - 4n \\\
  implies m = \\frac{100 - 4n}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Ensure \\(m\\) is an integer:**\n\
  \   For \\(m\\) to be an integer, \\(100 - 4n\\) must be divisible by 3. This gives\
  \ the condition:\n   \\[\n   100 - 4n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3} \\implies 100 \\equiv\
  \ 4n \\pmod{3}.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(100 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\) and \\(4 \\equiv\
  \ 1 \\pmod{3}\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   1 \\equiv n \\pmod{3} \\implies n \\equiv\
  \ 1 \\pmod{3}.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(n\\) can be written as \\(n = 3k + 1\\\
  ) for some integer \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Substitute \\(n = 3k + 1\\) into the expression\
  \ for \\(m\\):**\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{100 - 4(3k + 1)}{3} = \\frac{100 - 12k -\
  \ 4}{3} = \\frac{96 - 12k}{3} = 32 - 4k.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Express \\(\\left| m -\
  \ n \\right|\\) in terms of \\(k\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left| m - n \\right| = \\left|\
  \ (32 - 4k) - (3k + 1) \\right| = \\left| 31 - 7k \\right|.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Minimize\
  \ \\(\\left| 31 - 7k \\right|\\):**\n   We want to find the integer \\(k\\) that\
  \ minimizes \\(\\left| 31 - 7k \\right|\\). This occurs when \\(31 - 7k\\) is as\
  \ close to 0 as possible.\n\n   Solving \\(31 - 7k = 0\\) gives \\(k = \\frac{31}{7}\
  \ \\approx 4.428\\). The closest integers to \\(4.428\\) are \\(k = 4\\) and \\\
  (k = 5\\).\n\n   - For \\(k = 4\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left| 31 - 7(4) \\right| =\
  \ \\left| 31 - 28 \\right| = 3.\n     \\]\n\n   - For \\(k = 5\\):\n     \\[\n \
  \    \\left| 31 - 7(5) \\right| = \\left| 31 - 35 \\right| = 4.\n     \\]\n\n  \
  \ The smallest value is \\(3\\).\n\n6. **Verify the solution:**\n   For \\(k = 4\\\
  ), \\(n = 3(4) + 1 = 13\\) and \\(m = 32 - 4(4) = 16\\). Check:\n   \\[\n   3(16)\
  \ + 4(13) = 48 + 52 = 100.\n   \\]\n   The equation holds, and \\(\\left| m - n\
  \ \\right| = \\left| 16 - 13 \\right| = 3\\).\n\nThus, the smallest possible value\
  \ of \\(\\left| m - n \\right|\\) is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is $3$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
