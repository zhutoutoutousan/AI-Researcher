answer: 'To find the value of \( c \) such that the circle has a radius of length
  1, we first rewrite the equation of the circle in standard form. The standard form
  of a circle''s equation is:


  \[

  (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2,

  \]


  where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.


  Starting with the given equation:


  \[

  x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0,

  \]


  we complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).


  ### Step 1: Complete the square for \( x \)

  The \( x \)-terms are \( x^2 - 10x \). To complete the square:

  \[

  x^2 - 10x = (x^2 - 10x + 25) - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Complete the square for \( y \)

  The \( y \)-terms are \( y^2 + 6y \). To complete the square:

  \[

  y^2 + 6y = (y^2 + 6y + 9) - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Rewrite the equation

  Substitute the completed squares back into the equation:

  \[

  (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0.

  \]


  Combine the constants:

  \[

  (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0.

  \]


  Move the constants to the other side:

  \[

  (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Compare with the standard form

  The standard form of a circle is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\). Comparing this
  with the rewritten equation:

  \[

  (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c,

  \]


  we see that the radius squared is \( r^2 = 34 - c \).


  ### Step 5: Set the radius to 1

  We are given that the radius \( r = 1 \), so:

  \[

  r^2 = 1^2 = 1.

  \]


  Thus:

  \[

  34 - c = 1.

  \]


  Solve for \( c \):

  \[

  c = 34 - 1 = 33.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 33 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
