answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance on the map that\
  \ corresponds to a real-life distance of 53.25 miles. We know that 3 inches on the\
  \ map equates to 10 miles in real life. \n\nFirst, we find the scale factor by dividing\
  \ the real-life distance by the corresponding map distance:\n\\[\n\\text{Scale factor}\
  \ = \\frac{10 \\text{ miles}}{3 \\text{ inches}} = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ miles per\
  \ inch}.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the map distance \\( x \\) that corresponds\
  \ to 53.25 miles. We set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{3} \\text{ miles per\
  \ inch} = \\frac{53.25 \\text{ miles}}{x \\text{ inches}}.\n\\]\n\nTo solve for\
  \ \\( x \\), we rearrange the equation:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{53.25 \\text{ miles}}{\\\
  frac{10}{3} \\text{ miles per inch}} = 53.25 \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{159.75}{10}\
  \ = 15.975 \\text{ inches}.\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the distance on\
  \ the map expressed as a fraction. We convert 15.975 to a fraction:\n\\[\n15.975\
  \ = \\frac{15975}{1000} = \\frac{639}{40}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance between the\
  \ buildings on the map is \\( \\frac{639}{40} \\) inches.\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is \\(\\frac{639}{40}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
