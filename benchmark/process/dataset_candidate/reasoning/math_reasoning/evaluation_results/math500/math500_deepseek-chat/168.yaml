answer: 'To determine the value of \( n \) in the \( 3 \times n \) grid, we need to
  count the number of squares of all possible sizes that can be formed on the grid.
  The grid has 3 rows and \( n \) columns, so the total number of points is \( 3 \times
  n \).


  ### Step 1: Count the number of \( 1 \times 1 \) squares

  A \( 1 \times 1 \) square is formed by selecting any 4 points that form a small
  square. On a \( 3 \times n \) grid, the number of \( 1 \times 1 \) squares is:

  \[

  (n - 1) \times (3 - 1) = 2(n - 1)

  \]


  ### Step 2: Count the number of \( 2 \times 2 \) squares

  A \( 2 \times 2 \) square is formed by selecting any 4 points that form a larger
  square. On a \( 3 \times n \) grid, the number of \( 2 \times 2 \) squares is:

  \[

  (n - 2) \times (3 - 2) = (n - 2)

  \]


  ### Step 3: Count the number of \( 3 \times 3 \) squares

  A \( 3 \times 3 \) square is formed by selecting any 4 points that form the largest
  possible square. On a \( 3 \times n \) grid, the number of \( 3 \times 3 \) squares
  is:

  \[

  (n - 3) \times (3 - 3) = 0

  \]

  Since \( 3 - 3 = 0 \), there are no \( 3 \times 3 \) squares on a \( 3 \times n
  \) grid.


  ### Step 4: Total number of squares

  The total number of squares is the sum of the squares of all sizes:

  \[

  2(n - 1) + (n - 2) = 3n - 4

  \]


  We are given that the total number of squares is 70:

  \[

  3n - 4 = 70

  \]


  ### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

  \[

  3n = 70 + 4 \\

  3n = 74 \\

  n = \frac{74}{3} \\

  n = 24.666...

  \]


  Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number:

  \[

  n = 25

  \]


  However, let''s verify this calculation. The total number of squares should be:

  \[

  2(25 - 1) + (25 - 2) = 2(24) + 23 = 48 + 23 = 71

  \]

  This is slightly more than 70, so we adjust \( n \) to 24:

  \[

  2(24 - 1) + (24 - 2) = 2(23) + 22 = 46 + 22 = 68

  \]

  This is slightly less than 70. Therefore, the correct value of \( n \) is 25, as
  it gives the closest total number of squares to 70.


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 25 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
