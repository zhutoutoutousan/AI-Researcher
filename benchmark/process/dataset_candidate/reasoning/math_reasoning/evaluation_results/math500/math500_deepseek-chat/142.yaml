answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct ways to
  arrange the members of the Senate committee around a circular table, given that
  all members of each party must sit next to each other.


  ### Step 1: Treat each party as a single block

  Since all members of each party must sit together, we can treat each party (Democrats,
  Republicans, and Independent) as a single "block." This gives us 3 blocks to arrange
  around the table.


  ### Step 2: Arrange the blocks around the table

  For circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange \( n \) distinct blocks
  is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 3 \), so the number of ways to arrange the blocks is:

  \[

  (3-1)! = 2! = 2

  \]


  ### Step 3: Arrange the members within each block

  - **Democrats:** There are 5 Democrats, and they can be arranged among themselves
  in \( 5! \) ways.

  - **Republicans:** There are 5 Republicans, and they can be arranged among themselves
  in \( 5! \) ways.

  - **Independent:** There is only 1 Independent, so there is only 1 way to arrange
  them.


  ### Step 4: Multiply the arrangements

  The total number of distinct arrangements is the product of the number of ways to
  arrange the blocks and the number of ways to arrange the members within each block:

  \[

  2! \times 5! \times 5! \times 1 = 2 \times 120 \times 120 \times 1 = 28,800

  \]


  ### Final Answer

  The total number of distinct ways to arrange the members around the table is \(
  28,800 \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(28800\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
