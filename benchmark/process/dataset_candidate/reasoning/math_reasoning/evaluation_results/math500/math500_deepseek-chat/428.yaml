answer: 'To find the minimum value of the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} +
  \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\) given the constraint \(a + b + c + d = 1\), we can
  use the **Arithmetic Mean-Harmonic Mean (AM-HM) Inequality**. The AM-HM Inequality
  states that for positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal
  to the harmonic mean. Specifically, for positive real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \dots,
  x_n\), we have:


  \[

  \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n} \geq \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} +
  \dots + \frac{1}{x_n}}.

  \]


  ### Step 1: Apply AM-HM Inequality

  We apply the AM-HM Inequality to the terms \(\frac{1}{a}\), \(\frac{1}{b}\), \(\frac{4}{c}\),
  and \(\frac{16}{d}\). Let us denote these terms as follows:


  \[

  x_1 = \frac{1}{a}, \quad x_2 = \frac{1}{b}, \quad x_3 = \frac{4}{c}, \quad x_4 =
  \frac{16}{d}.

  \]


  The AM-HM Inequality gives:


  \[

  \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4}{4} \geq \frac{4}{\frac{1}{x_1} + \frac{1}{x_2} + \frac{1}{x_3}
  + \frac{1}{x_4}}.

  \]


  Substituting the values of \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\), we get:


  \[

  \frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}}{4} \geq \frac{4}{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{a}}
  + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{b}} + \frac{1}{\frac{4}{c}} + \frac{1}{\frac{16}{d}}}.

  \]


  Simplifying the right-hand side:


  \[

  \frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}}{4} \geq \frac{4}{a
  + b + \frac{c}{4} + \frac{d}{16}}.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Use the Constraint \(a + b + c + d = 1\)

  We know that \(a + b + c + d = 1\). To minimize the expression \(\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}
  + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d}\), we need to maximize the denominator \(a + b + \frac{c}{4}
  + \frac{d}{16}\). This occurs when \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are chosen such
  that the terms \(a\), \(b\), \(\frac{c}{4}\), and \(\frac{d}{16}\) are balanced.


  ### Step 3: Find the Optimal Values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\)

  Let us assume that \(a = b = c/4 = d/16\). Let \(a = b = k\), \(c = 4k\), and \(d
  = 16k\). Substituting into the constraint \(a + b + c + d = 1\):


  \[

  k + k + 4k + 16k = 1 \implies 22k = 1 \implies k = \frac{1}{22}.

  \]


  Thus, the optimal values are:


  \[

  a = b = \frac{1}{22}, \quad c = \frac{4}{22} = \frac{2}{11}, \quad d = \frac{16}{22}
  = \frac{8}{11}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Compute the Minimum Value

  Substitute these values into the expression:


  \[

  \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{4}{c} + \frac{16}{d} = 22 + 22 + 4 \cdot \frac{11}{2}
  + 16 \cdot \frac{11}{8}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  22 + 22 + 22 + 22 = 88.

  \]


  Thus, the minimum value of the expression is \(88\).


  ### Final Answer:

  Final Answer: The final answer is \(88\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
