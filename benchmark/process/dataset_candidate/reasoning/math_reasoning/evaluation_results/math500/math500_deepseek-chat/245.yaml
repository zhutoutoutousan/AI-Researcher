answer: 'To find the remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 - 1 \), we can
  use the **Remainder Theorem**. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of
  a polynomial \( f(x) \) divided by a quadratic divisor \( x^2 - a^2 \) can be found
  by evaluating \( f(x) \) at \( x = a \) and \( x = -a \).


  Here, the divisor is \( x^2 - 1 \), which can be factored as \( (x - 1)(x + 1) \).
  Therefore, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \), and then use
  these values to find the remainder.

  ### Step 1: Evaluate \( f(1) \)

  Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) \):

  \[

  f(1) = (1)^{10} + 5(1)^9 - 8(1)^8 + 7(1)^7 - (1)^6 - 12(1)^5 + 4(1)^4 - 8(1)^3 +
  12(1)^2 - 5(1) - 5.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  f(1) = 1 + 5 - 8 + 7 - 1 - 12 + 4 - 8 + 12 - 5 - 5.

  \]

  \[

  f(1) = (1 + 5 + 7 + 4 + 12) - (8 + 1 + 12 + 8 + 5 + 5).

  \]

  \[

  f(1) = 29 - 39 = -10.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Evaluate \( f(-1) \)

  Substitute \( x = -1 \) into \( f(x) \):

  \[

  f(-1) = (-1)^{10} + 5(-1)^9 - 8(-1)^8 + 7(-1)^7 - (-1)^6 - 12(-1)^5 + 4(-1)^4 -
  8(-1)^3 + 12(-1)^2 - 5(-1) - 5.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  f(-1) = 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1 + 12 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 5 - 5.

  \]

  \[

  f(-1) = (1 + 12 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 5) - (5 + 8 + 7 + 1 + 5).

  \]

  \[

  f(-1) = 42 - 26 = 16.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Find the remainder

  The remainder when \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 - 1 \) is a linear polynomial
  of the form \( R(x) = Ax + B \). Using the values of \( f(1) \) and \( f(-1) \),
  we can set up the following system of equations:

  \[

  R(1) = A(1) + B = f(1) = -10,

  \]

  \[

  R(-1) = A(-1) + B = f(-1) = 16.

  \]

  This gives:

  \[

  A + B = -10,

  \]

  \[

  -A + B = 16.

  \]

  Add the two equations to eliminate \( A \):

  \[

  2B = 6 \implies B = 3.

  \]

  Substitute \( B = 3 \) into the first equation:

  \[

  A + 3 = -10 \implies A = -13.

  \]

  Thus, the remainder is:

  \[

  R(x) = -13x + 3.

  \]

  Final Answer: The final answer is \(-13x + 3\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
