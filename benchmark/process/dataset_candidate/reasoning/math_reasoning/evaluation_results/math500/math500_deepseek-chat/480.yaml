answer: 'To solve the problem, let''s first recall that \(\omega\) is a complex number
  satisfying \(\omega^3 = 1\). This means \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, and
  its possible values are \(1\), \(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega \neq
  1\) and \(\omega^2 \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity satisfy the equation \(1 +
  \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).


  We are tasked with finding all possible values of:

  \[

  \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.

  \]


  ### Step 1: Simplify the expression

  First, combine the two fractions:

  \[

  \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1
  + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.

  \]


  Simplify the numerator:

  \[

  (1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega) = 2 + \omega + \omega^2.

  \]


  Simplify the denominator:

  \[

  (1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.

  \]


  Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), the denominator becomes:

  \[

  1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Substitute the known identity

  Recall that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). Therefore:

  \[

  2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.

  \]


  Thus, the expression simplifies to:

  \[

  \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Verify for all cube roots of unity

  We must ensure that this result holds for all cube roots of unity except \(\omega
  = 1\) (since \(1 + \omega\) and \(1 + \omega^2\) would be zero in that case, making
  the expression undefined).


  - For \(\omega = 1\), the expression is undefined.

  - For \(\omega \neq 1\), the expression simplifies to \(1\), as shown above.


  Thus, the only possible value of the expression is \(1\).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
