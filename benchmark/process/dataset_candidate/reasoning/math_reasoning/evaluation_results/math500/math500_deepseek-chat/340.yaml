answer: "To find the angle between vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} -\
  \ \\mathbf{b}\\), we can use the properties of vectors and angles. Let's break this\
  \ down step by step.\n\n1. **Given Information:**\n   - The angle between \\(\\\
  mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(29^\\circ\\).\n   - The angle between \\\
  (\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(84^\\circ\\).\n\n2. **Visual\
  \ Representation:**\n   - Consider the vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), \\(\\mathbf{b}\\\
  ), and \\(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}\\) forming a triangle.\n   - The angle between\
  \ \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(29^\\circ\\).\n   - The angle between\
  \ \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(84^\\circ\\).\n\n\
  3. **Using the Law of Sines:**\n   - In the triangle formed by \\(\\mathbf{a}\\\
  ), \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}\\), the sum of the angles\
  \ must be \\(180^\\circ\\).\n   - Let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle between \\(\\mathbf{a}\\\
  ) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}\\).\n   - Then, the angle between \\(\\mathbf{a}\
  \ - \\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is \\(\\theta\\).\n   - The angle between\
  \ \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(29^\\circ\\).\n   - The angle between\
  \ \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(84^\\circ\\).\n\n\
  4. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - The sum of the angles in the triangle is:\n\
  \     \\[\n     \\theta + 29^\\circ + 84^\\circ = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n   - Solving\
  \ for \\(\\theta\\):\n     \\[\n     \\theta = 180^\\circ - 29^\\circ - 84^\\circ\
  \ = 67^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The angle between \\(\\mathbf{a}\\\
  ) and \\(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}\\) is \\(67^\\circ\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is \\(67^\\circ\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
