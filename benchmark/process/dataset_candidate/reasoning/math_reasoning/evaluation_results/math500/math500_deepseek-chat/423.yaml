answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to find the largest integer less than 2010
  that satisfies the following conditions:

  1. \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)

  2. \( x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \)

  3. \( x \equiv 10 \pmod{13} \)


  ---


  ### Step 1: Solve the first two congruences

  We start by solving the first two congruences:

  - \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \)

  - \( x \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \)


  Let \( x = 7k + 5 \), where \( k \) is an integer. Substitute this into the second
  congruence:

  \[

  7k + 5 \equiv 10 \pmod{11}

  \]

  \[

  7k \equiv 5 \pmod{11}

  \]


  To solve \( 7k \equiv 5 \pmod{11} \), we find the modular inverse of \( 7 \) modulo
  \( 11 \). The inverse of \( 7 \) is \( 8 \) because \( 7 \cdot 8 = 56 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}
  \). Multiply both sides by \( 8 \):

  \[

  k \equiv 5 \cdot 8 \pmod{11}

  \]

  \[

  k \equiv 40 \pmod{11}

  \]

  \[

  k \equiv 7 \pmod{11}

  \]


  Thus, \( k = 11m + 7 \), where \( m \) is an integer. Substitute back into \( x
  = 7k + 5 \):

  \[

  x = 7(11m + 7) + 5

  \]

  \[

  x = 77m + 49 + 5

  \]

  \[

  x = 77m + 54

  \]


  So, the general solution for the first two congruences is:

  \[

  x \equiv 54 \pmod{77}

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Incorporate the third congruence

  Now we incorporate the third congruence:

  \[

  x \equiv 10 \pmod{13}

  \]


  Substitute \( x = 77m + 54 \) into the third congruence:

  \[

  77m + 54 \equiv 10 \pmod{13}

  \]


  Simplify \( 77m + 54 \) modulo \( 13 \):

  - \( 77 \equiv 12 \pmod{13} \) (since \( 77 = 5 \cdot 13 + 12 \))

  - \( 54 \equiv 2 \pmod{13} \) (since \( 54 = 4 \cdot 13 + 2 \))


  Thus:

  \[

  12m + 2 \equiv 10 \pmod{13}

  \]

  \[

  12m \equiv 8 \pmod{13}

  \]


  To solve \( 12m \equiv 8 \pmod{13} \), find the modular inverse of \( 12 \) modulo
  \( 13 \). The inverse of \( 12 \) is \( 12 \) because \( 12 \cdot 12 = 144 \equiv
  1 \pmod{13} \). Multiply both sides by \( 12 \):

  \[

  m \equiv 8 \cdot 12 \pmod{13}

  \]

  \[

  m \equiv 96 \pmod{13}

  \]

  \[

  m \equiv 5 \pmod{13}

  \]


  Thus, \( m = 13n + 5 \), where \( n \) is an integer. Substitute back into \( x
  = 77m + 54 \):

  \[

  x = 77(13n + 5) + 54

  \]

  \[

  x = 1001n + 385 + 54

  \]

  \[

  x = 1001n + 439

  \]


  So, the general solution for all three congruences is:

  \[

  x \equiv 439 \pmod{1001}

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Find the largest integer less than 2010

  We need the largest integer less than 2010 that satisfies \( x \equiv 439 \pmod{1001}
  \). Let \( x = 1001n + 439 \), and solve for \( n \) such that \( x < 2010 \):

  \[

  1001n + 439 < 2010

  \]

  \[

  1001n < 1571

  \]

  \[

  n < \frac{1571}{1001}

  \]

  \[

  n < 1.569

  \]


  The largest integer \( n \) satisfying this inequality is \( n = 1 \). Substitute
  \( n = 1 \) into \( x = 1001n + 439 \):

  \[

  x = 1001(1) + 439

  \]

  \[

  x = 1440

  \]
