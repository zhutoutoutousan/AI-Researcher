answer: 'To find the value of \( b \) in the continued fraction representation of
  \( \sqrt[3]{2} \), we start by expressing \( \sqrt[3]{2} \) as a continued fraction.
  The general form of a continued fraction is:


  \[

  \sqrt[3]{2} = a + \cfrac{1}{b + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}

  \]


  where \( a, b, c, d, \dots \) are positive integers.


  ### Step 1: Find the integer part \( a \)

  First, we determine the integer part \( a \) of \( \sqrt[3]{2} \). Since \( 1^3
  = 1 \) and \( 2^3 = 8 \), we know that \( 1 < \sqrt[3]{2} < 2 \). Therefore, \(
  a = 1 \).


  ### Step 2: Compute the fractional part

  Next, we compute the fractional part of \( \sqrt[3]{2} \):


  \[

  \sqrt[3]{2} - 1 \approx 0.2599

  \]


  ### Step 3: Find the reciprocal of the fractional part

  The reciprocal of the fractional part is:


  \[

  \frac{1}{0.2599} \approx 3.847

  \]


  This gives us \( b = 3 \), since \( b \) is the integer part of the reciprocal.


  ### Step 4: Verify \( b \)

  To confirm, we can write:


  \[

  \sqrt[3]{2} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{3 + \cfrac{1}{c + \cfrac{1}{d + \dotsb}}}

  \]


  Thus, \( b = 3 \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 3 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
