answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to form a\
  \ subcommittee of 5 members from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, ensuring\
  \ that the subcommittee has at least one member from each party.\n\n### Step 1:\
  \ Total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members\nThe total number of\
  \ ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats) is\
  \ given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{14}{5} = \\frac{14!}{5! \\cdot\
  \ 9!} = 2002.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Subtract the cases where the subcommittee has\
  \ only Republicans or only Democrats\n- **Case 1: All members are Republicans**\n\
  \  The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{8}{5}\
  \ = \\frac{8!}{5! \\cdot 3!} = 56.\n  \\]\n\n- **Case 2: All members are Democrats**\n\
  \  The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is:\n  \\[\n  \\binom{6}{5} =\
  \ \\frac{6!}{5! \\cdot 1!} = 6.\n  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the number of valid\
  \ subcommittees\nSubtract the invalid cases (all Republicans or all Democrats) from\
  \ the total number of subcommittees:\n\\[\n2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940.\n\\]\n\n### Final\
  \ Answer:\nThe number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least\
  \ one member from each party is \\(\\boxed{1940}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is $1940$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
