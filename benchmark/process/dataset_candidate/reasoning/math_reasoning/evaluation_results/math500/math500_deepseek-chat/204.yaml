answer: "To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum value of the expression\
  \ \\(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\\), where \\(a, b, c, d\\) are\
  \ distinct complex numbers on the unit circle (i.e., \\(|a| = |b| = |c| = |d| =\
  \ 1\\)) and \\(a + b + c + d = 0\\).\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding\
  \ the problem**:\n   - Since \\(a, b, c, d\\) lie on the unit circle, their magnitudes\
  \ are 1.\n   - The condition \\(a + b + c + d = 0\\) implies that these four complex\
  \ numbers form a quadrilateral in the complex plane that closes back to the origin.\n\
  \n2. **Key observations**:\n   - The expression \\(|(a + b)(a + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b\
  \ + d)(c + d)|\\) involves all pairwise sums of \\(a, b, c, d\\).\n   - The maximum\
  \ value of this expression occurs when the pairwise sums are as large as possible.\n\
  \n3. **Symmetry and optimization**:\n   - By symmetry, the maximum value is achieved\
  \ when \\(a, b, c, d\\) are equally spaced on the unit circle. This corresponds\
  \ to the vertices of a square.\n   - If \\(a, b, c, d\\) are the fourth roots of\
  \ unity, they satisfy \\(a + b + c + d = 0\\) and are equally spaced.\n\n4. **Calculating\
  \ the pairwise sums**:\n   - For the fourth roots of unity, the pairwise sums \\\
  (a + b\\), \\(a + c\\), \\(a + d\\), \\(b + c\\), \\(b + d\\), and \\(c + d\\) can\
  \ be computed explicitly.\n   - For example, if \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = i\\), \\(c =\
  \ -1\\), and \\(d = -i\\), then:\n     \\[\n     a + b = 1 + i, \\quad a + c = 0,\
  \ \\quad a + d = 1 - i, \\quad b + c = -1 + i, \\quad b + d = 0, \\quad c + d =\
  \ -1 - i.\n     \\]\n   - The magnitudes of these sums are:\n     \\[\n     |a +\
  \ b| = \\sqrt{2}, \\quad |a + c| = 0, \\quad |a + d| = \\sqrt{2}, \\quad |b + c|\
  \ = \\sqrt{2}, \\quad |b + d| = 0, \\quad |c + d| = \\sqrt{2}.\n     \\]\n   - However,\
  \ this configuration gives a product of 0, which is not the maximum.\n\n5. **Alternative\
  \ configuration**:\n   - To maximize the product, we need to avoid zero sums. This\
  \ can be achieved by rotating the configuration slightly.\n   - For example, let\
  \ \\(a = e^{i\\theta}\\), \\(b = e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)}\\), \\(c = e^{i(\\theta\
  \ + \\pi)}\\), and \\(d = e^{i(\\theta + 3\\pi/2)}\\). Then:\n     \\[\n     a +\
  \ b + c + d = 0,\n     \\]\n     and the pairwise sums are:\n     \\[\n     a +\
  \ b = e^{i\\theta} + e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)}, \\quad a + c = e^{i\\theta} + e^{i(\\\
  theta + \\pi)}, \\quad a + d = e^{i\\theta} + e^{i(\\theta + 3\\pi/2)}, \\quad b\
  \ + c = e^{i(\\theta + \\pi/2)} + e^{i(\\theta + \\pi)}, \\quad b + d = e^{i(\\\
  theta + \\pi/2)} + e^{i(\\theta + 3\\pi/2)}, \\quad c + d = e^{i(\\theta + \\pi)}\
  \ + e^{i(\\theta + 3\\pi/2)}.\n     \\]\n   - The magnitudes of these sums are all\
  \ \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), except for \\(a + c\\) and \\(b + d\\), which are 0. To maximize\
  \ the product, we need to avoid these zero sums.\n\n6. **Optimal configuration**:\n\
  \   - The optimal configuration occurs when the pairwise sums are all non-zero and\
  \ as large as possible. This happens when the points are arranged in a way that\
  \ no two points are diametrically opposite each other.\n   - In this case, the maximum\
  \ product is achieved when the pairwise sums are all \\(\\sqrt{2}\\), and there\
  \ are no zero sums.\n\n7. **Final calculation**:\n   - The product \\(|(a + b)(a\
  \ + c)(a + d)(b + c)(b + d)(c + d)|\\) is maximized when all six pairwise sums have\
  \ magnitude \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - Thus, the maximum value is:\n     \\[\n     (\\\
  sqrt{2})^6 = 2^{3} = 8.\n     \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(8\\).\

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
