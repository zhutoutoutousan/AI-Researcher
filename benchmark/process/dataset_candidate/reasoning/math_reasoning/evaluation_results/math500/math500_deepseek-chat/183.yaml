answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to combine the terms \(\sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) into the form \(\dfrac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}\),
  where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive integers and \(c\) is as small as possible.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Rationalize the denominators

  First, rationalize \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\):

  \[

  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \quad \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Combine like terms

  Now, rewrite the original expression using the rationalized forms:

  \[

  \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.

  \]


  Combine the \(\sqrt{2}\) terms:

  \[

  \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}.

  \]


  Combine the \(\sqrt{3}\) terms:

  \[

  \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Combine into a single fraction

  Now, combine the two results into a single fraction. To do this, find a common denominator
  for \(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\) and \(\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}\). The least common denominator
  (LCD) of \(2\) and \(3\) is \(6\):

  \[

  \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6}, \quad \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6}.

  \]


  Add the two fractions:

  \[

  \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6} + \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{9\sqrt{2} + 8\sqrt{3}}{6}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Identify \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)

  The expression is now in the form \(\dfrac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}\), where:

  \[

  a = 9, \quad b = 8, \quad c = 6.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 5: Compute \(a + b + c\)

  Finally, compute \(a + b + c\):

  \[

  a + b + c = 9 + 8 + 6 = 23.

  \]

  Final Answer: The final answer is \(23\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
