answer: "To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(3339\\), \\(2961\\), and\
  \ \\(1491\\), we can use the **Euclidean algorithm**. This algorithm works by repeatedly\
  \ applying the rule that \\(\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a \\mod b)\\) until \\(b = 0\\\
  ). We will first find the GCD of two numbers and then find the GCD of the result\
  \ with the third number.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Find \\(\\gcd(3339, 2961)\\)\n1.\
  \ Divide \\(3339\\) by \\(2961\\):\n   \\[\n   3339 = 1 \\cdot 2961 + 378\n   \\\
  ]\n   Now, \\(\\gcd(3339, 2961) = \\gcd(2961, 378)\\).\n\n2. Divide \\(2961\\) by\
  \ \\(378\\):\n   \\[\n   2961 = 7 \\cdot 378 + 315\n   \\]\n   Now, \\(\\gcd(2961,\
  \ 378) = \\gcd(378, 315)\\).\n\n3. Divide \\(378\\) by \\(315\\):\n   \\[\n   378\
  \ = 1 \\cdot 315 + 63\n   \\]\n   Now, \\(\\gcd(378, 315) = \\gcd(315, 63)\\).\n\
  \n4. Divide \\(315\\) by \\(63\\):\n   \\[\n   315 = 5 \\cdot 63 + 0\n   \\]\n \
  \  Since the remainder is \\(0\\), \\(\\gcd(315, 63) = 63\\).\n\nThus, \\(\\gcd(3339,\
  \ 2961) = 63\\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find \\(\\gcd(63, 1491)\\)\n1. Divide \\\
  (1491\\) by \\(63\\):\n   \\[\n   1491 = 23 \\cdot 63 + 42\n   \\]\n   Now, \\(\\\
  gcd(63, 1491) = \\gcd(63, 42)\\).\n\n2. Divide \\(63\\) by \\(42\\):\n   \\[\n \
  \  63 = 1 \\cdot 42 + 21\n   \\]\n   Now, \\(\\gcd(63, 42) = \\gcd(42, 21)\\).\n\
  \n3. Divide \\(42\\) by \\(21\\):\n   \\[\n   42 = 2 \\cdot 21 + 0\n   \\]\n   Since\
  \ the remainder is \\(0\\), \\(\\gcd(42, 21) = 21\\).\n\nThus, \\(\\gcd(63, 1491)\
  \ = 21\\).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe greatest common divisor of \\(3339\\\
  ), \\(2961\\), and \\(1491\\) is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is $21$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
