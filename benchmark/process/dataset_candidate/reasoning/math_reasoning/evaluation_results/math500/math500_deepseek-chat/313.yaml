answer: "To determine the unicycle's speed, we need to calculate the distance traveled\
  \ per second. \n\n1. **Calculate the circumference of the wheel:**\n   The circumference\
  \ \\( C \\) of a circle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   C = 2\\pi r\n   \\\
  ]\n   where \\( r \\) is the radius. For the unicycle's wheel with a radius of 9\
  \ inches:\n   \\[\n   C = 2\\pi \\times 9 = 18\\pi \\text{ inches}.\n   \\]\n\n\
  2. **Determine the distance traveled in 2 revolutions:**\n   Since the wheel makes\
  \ 2 revolutions, the total distance \\( D \\) traveled is:\n   \\[\n   D = 2 \\\
  times C = 2 \\times 18\\pi = 36\\pi \\text{ inches}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the\
  \ speed:**\n   The wheel makes 2 revolutions every 3 seconds, so the speed \\( S\
  \ \\) in inches per second is:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{D}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{36\\\
  pi}{3} = 12\\pi \\text{ inches per second}.\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(12\\pi\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
