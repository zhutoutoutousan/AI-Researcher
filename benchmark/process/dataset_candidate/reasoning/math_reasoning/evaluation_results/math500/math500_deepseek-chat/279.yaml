answer: "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the areas of the regions \\(\
  \ X \\), \\( Y \\), and \\( Z \\) and then find the difference between the largest\
  \ and smallest areas.\n\n1. **Area of Region \\( X \\):**\n   - Region \\( X \\\
  ) is the area of the smallest circle with radius \\( 4 \\).\n   - The area is \\\
  ( \\pi r^2 = \\pi (4)^2 = 16\\pi \\).\n\n2. **Area of Region \\( Y \\):**\n   -\
  \ Region \\( Y \\) is the area between the middle circle (radius \\( 6 \\)) and\
  \ the smallest circle (radius \\( 4 \\)).\n   - The area is \\( \\pi (6)^2 - \\\
  pi (4)^2 = 36\\pi - 16\\pi = 20\\pi \\).\n\n3. **Area of Region \\( Z \\):**\n \
  \  - Region \\( Z \\) is the area between the largest circle (radius \\( 7 \\))\
  \ and the middle circle (radius \\( 6 \\)).\n   - The area is \\( \\pi (7)^2 - \\\
  pi (6)^2 = 49\\pi - 36\\pi = 13\\pi \\).\n\n4. **Determine the Largest and Smallest\
  \ Areas:**\n   - The largest area is \\( 20\\pi \\) (Region \\( Y \\)).\n   - The\
  \ smallest area is \\( 13\\pi \\) (Region \\( Z \\)).\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference:**\n\
  \   - The difference is \\( 20\\pi - 13\\pi = 7\\pi \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is \\( 7\\pi \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
