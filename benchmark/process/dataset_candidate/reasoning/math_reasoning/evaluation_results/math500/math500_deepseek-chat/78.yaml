answer: 'To solve for the ordered pair \((a, b)\), we start with the given equation:


  \[

  f(x) - f(a) = (x - a)^2 (x - b).

  \]


  First, expand the right-hand side:


  \[

  (x - a)^2 (x - b) = (x^2 - 2a x + a^2)(x - b) = x^3 - b x^2 - 2a x^2 + 2a b x +
  a^2 x - a^2 b.

  \]


  Simplify the expanded form:


  \[

  x^3 + (-b - 2a) x^2 + (2a b + a^2) x - a^2 b.

  \]


  Now, compute \(f(x) - f(a)\):


  \[

  f(x) - f(a) = (x^3 + 3x^2 + 1) - (a^3 + 3a^2 + 1) = x^3 + 3x^2 - a^3 - 3a^2.

  \]


  Set the two expressions equal to each other:


  \[

  x^3 + 3x^2 - a^3 - 3a^2 = x^3 + (-b - 2a) x^2 + (2a b + a^2) x - a^2 b.

  \]


  By comparing coefficients, we get the following system of equations:


  1. For \(x^2\): \(3 = -b - 2a\),

  2. For \(x\): \(0 = 2a b + a^2\),

  3. For the constant term: \(-a^3 - 3a^2 = -a^2 b\).


  From the first equation, solve for \(b\):


  \[

  3 = -b - 2a \implies b = -3 - 2a.

  \]


  Substitute \(b = -3 - 2a\) into the second equation:


  \[

  0 = 2a(-3 - 2a) + a^2 = -6a - 4a^2 + a^2 = -6a - 3a^2.

  \]


  Factor out \(-3a\):


  \[

  -3a(a + 2) = 0.

  \]


  Since \(a \neq 0\), we have \(a = -2\).


  Substitute \(a = -2\) into \(b = -3 - 2a\):


  \[

  b = -3 - 2(-2) = -3 + 4 = 1.

  \]


  Thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) is \((-2, 1)\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \((-2, 1)\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
