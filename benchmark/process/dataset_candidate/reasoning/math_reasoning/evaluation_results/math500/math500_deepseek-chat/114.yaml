answer: 'To solve for the integers \( C \) and \( D \), we start by equating the given
  equation:


  \[

  \frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{x^2+5x-24}.

  \]


  First, factor the denominator on the right-hand side:


  \[

  x^2 + 5x - 24 = (x-3)(x+8).

  \]


  Thus, the equation becomes:


  \[

  \frac{C}{x-3} + \frac{D}{x+8} = \frac{4x-23}{(x-3)(x+8)}.

  \]


  To combine the left-hand side, we use a common denominator:


  \[

  \frac{C(x+8) + D(x-3)}{(x-3)(x+8)} = \frac{4x-23}{(x-3)(x+8)}.

  \]


  Since the denominators are equal, we equate the numerators:


  \[

  C(x+8) + D(x-3) = 4x - 23.

  \]


  Expand the left-hand side:


  \[

  Cx + 8C + Dx - 3D = 4x - 23.

  \]


  Combine like terms:


  \[

  (C + D)x + (8C - 3D) = 4x - 23.

  \]


  Now, equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:


  1. For \( x \): \( C + D = 4 \).

  2. For the constant term: \( 8C - 3D = -23 \).


  We now solve the system of equations:


  \[

  \begin{cases}

  C + D = 4, \\

  8C - 3D = -23.

  \end{cases}

  \]


  From the first equation, \( D = 4 - C \). Substitute this into the second equation:


  \[

  8C - 3(4 - C) = -23.

  \]


  Simplify:


  \[

  8C - 12 + 3C = -23.

  \]


  Combine like terms:


  \[

  11C - 12 = -23.

  \]


  Solve for \( C \):


  \[

  11C = -11 \implies C = -1.

  \]


  Now, substitute \( C = -1 \) into \( D = 4 - C \):


  \[

  D = 4 - (-1) = 5.

  \]


  Finally, the product \( CD \) is:


  \[

  CD = (-1)(5) = -5.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is $-5$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
