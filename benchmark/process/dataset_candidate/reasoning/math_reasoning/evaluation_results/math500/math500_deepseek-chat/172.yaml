answer: "To solve this problem, we need to find the sixth term of an arithmetic sequence\
  \ given the fourth and eighth terms.\n\n1. **Recall the formula for the \\(n\\)-th\
  \ term of an arithmetic sequence:**\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n   \\]\n   where\
  \ \\(a_n\\) is the \\(n\\)-th term, \\(a_1\\) is the first term, and \\(d\\) is\
  \ the common difference.\n\n2. **Set up equations using the given terms:**\n   -\
  \ The fourth term (\\(a_4\\)) is 200:\n     \\[\n     a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\n   \
  \  \\]\n   - The eighth term (\\(a_8\\)) is 500:\n     \\[\n     a_8 = a_1 + 7d\
  \ = 500\n     \\]\n\n3. **Subtract the first equation from the second to solve for\
  \ \\(d\\):**\n   \\[\n   (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n \
  \  4d = 300\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   d = 75\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\(d = 75\\) back\
  \ into the equation for \\(a_4\\) to find \\(a_1\\):**\n   \\[\n   a_1 + 3(75) =\
  \ 200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_1 + 225 = 200\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_1 = 200 - 225 =\
  \ -25\n   \\]\n\n5. **Now, find the sixth term (\\(a_6\\)):**\n   \\[\n   a_6 =\
  \ a_1 + 5d\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_6 = -25 +\
  \ 375\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a_6 = 350\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is\
  \ $350$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
