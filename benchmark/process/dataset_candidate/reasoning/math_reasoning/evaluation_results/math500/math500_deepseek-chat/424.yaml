answer: 'To solve the problem, we start by understanding the relationship between
  \( y \) and \( x \). The problem states that \( y \) varies inversely as \( \sqrt{x}
  \). This means:


  \[

  y = \frac{k}{\sqrt{x}}

  \]


  where \( k \) is a constant of proportionality.


  ### Step 1: Find the constant \( k \)

  We are given that when \( x = 24 \), \( y = 15 \). Substituting these values into
  the equation:


  \[

  15 = \frac{k}{\sqrt{24}}

  \]


  First, simplify \( \sqrt{24} \):


  \[

  \sqrt{24} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 6} = 2\sqrt{6}

  \]


  Now, substitute back into the equation:


  \[

  15 = \frac{k}{2\sqrt{6}}

  \]


  Solve for \( k \):


  \[

  k = 15 \cdot 2\sqrt{6} = 30\sqrt{6}

  \]


  ### Step 2: Find \( x \) when \( y = 3 \)

  Now that we have \( k \), we can write the equation as:


  \[

  y = \frac{30\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{x}}

  \]


  We are asked to find \( x \) when \( y = 3 \). Substitute \( y = 3 \) into the equation:


  \[

  3 = \frac{30\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{x}}

  \]


  Solve for \( \sqrt{x} \):


  \[

  \sqrt{x} = \frac{30\sqrt{6}}{3} = 10\sqrt{6}

  \]


  Now, square both sides to solve for \( x \):


  \[

  x = (10\sqrt{6})^2 = 100 \cdot 6 = 600

  \]


  ### Final Answer:

  The final answer is \( 600 \). I hope it is correct.


  Final Answer: The final answer is $600$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
