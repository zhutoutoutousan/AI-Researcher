answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \((a_9)^9\) given the
  recurrence relation \(a_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i}\) and the condition \(a_3 =
  a_1\).


  ---


  ### Step 1: Compute \(a_2\) in terms of \(a_1\)

  Using the recurrence relation with \(i = 1\):

  \[

  a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Compute \(a_3\) in terms of \(a_1\)

  Using the recurrence relation with \(i = 2\):

  \[

  a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - a_2}.

  \]

  Substitute \(a_2 = \frac{1}{1 - a_1}\) into this equation:

  \[

  a_3 = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1}}.

  \]

  Simplify the denominator:

  \[

  1 - \frac{1}{1 - a_1} = \frac{(1 - a_1) - 1}{1 - a_1} = \frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1}.

  \]

  Thus:

  \[

  a_3 = \frac{1}{\frac{-a_1}{1 - a_1}} = \frac{1 - a_1}{-a_1} = \frac{a_1 - 1}{a_1}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Use the condition \(a_3 = a_1\)

  Set \(a_3 = a_1\):

  \[

  \frac{a_1 - 1}{a_1} = a_1.

  \]

  Multiply through by \(a_1\):

  \[

  a_1 - 1 = a_1^2.

  \]

  Rearrange:

  \[

  a_1^2 - a_1 + 1 = 0.

  \]

  This quadratic equation has no real solutions, but it has complex solutions:

  \[

  a_1 = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Observe the periodicity of the sequence

  The recurrence relation \(a_{i + 1} = \frac{1}{1 - a_i}\) is periodic with period
  3. This means:

  \[

  a_1 = a_4 = a_7 = \cdots, \quad a_2 = a_5 = a_8 = \cdots, \quad a_3 = a_6 = a_9
  = \cdots.

  \]

  Since \(a_3 = a_1\), we have:

  \[

  a_9 = a_3 = a_1.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 5: Compute \((a_9)^9\)

  Since \(a_9 = a_1\), we compute \((a_1)^9\). Recall that \(a_1\) satisfies \(a_1^2
  - a_1 + 1 = 0\). Using this relation, we can simplify powers of \(a_1\):

  \[

  a_1^2 = a_1 - 1, \quad a_1^3 = a_1 \cdot a_1^2 = a_1(a_1 - 1) = a_1^2 - a_1 = (a_1
  - 1) - a_1 = -1.

  \]

  Thus:

  \[

  a_1^3 = -1.

  \]

  Now compute \(a_1^9\):

  \[

  a_1^9 = (a_1^3)^3 = (-1)^3 = -1.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
