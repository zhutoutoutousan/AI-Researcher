answer: "To simplify the expression \\(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{27}}\\), follow these steps:\n\
  \n1. **Simplify the denominator**:  \n   \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) can be simplified by factoring\
  \ 27 into its prime factors:  \n   \\(27 = 3^3\\).  \n   Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{27}\
  \ = \\sqrt{3^3} = 3^{3/2} = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n2. **Rewrite the expression**:\
  \  \n   Substitute \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) with \\(3 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}\\):  \n   \\[\n \
  \  \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{27}} = \\frac{3}{3 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify\
  \ the fraction**:  \n   The 3 in the numerator and the 3 in the denominator cancel\
  \ out:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{3 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n   \\\
  ]\n\n4. **Rationalize the denominator**:  \n   To rationalize \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\\
  ), multiply the numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{\\\
  sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}.\n   \\]\n\n\
  Thus, the simplified form of \\(\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{27}}\\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\\
  ).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}\\). I hope it is\
  \ correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
