answer: 'To solve the problem, we can use the identity for the product of sines of
  angles in a symmetric pattern. Specifically, we can use the identity for the product
  of sines of angles that are evenly spaced around the unit circle.


  The given expression is:

  \[

  \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ
  \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ.

  \]


  Notice that the angles are symmetric around \(90^\circ\). We can pair the angles
  as follows:

  \[

  \sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin
  20^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin^2 20^\circ,

  \]

  \[

  \sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin
  40^\circ \sin 40^\circ = \sin^2 40^\circ,

  \]

  \[

  \sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin
  60^\circ \sin 60^\circ = \sin^2 60^\circ,

  \]

  \[

  \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin
  80^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \sin^2 80^\circ.

  \]


  Thus, the product becomes:

  \[

  \sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.

  \]


  We can further simplify this using the identity for the product of sines of angles
  in a symmetric pattern. The product of sines of angles spaced by \(20^\circ\) from
  \(20^\circ\) to \(160^\circ\) is known to be:

  \[

  \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ
  \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \frac{1}{256}.

  \]


  Therefore, the final answer is:

  \[

  \boxed{\frac{1}{256}}.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\frac{1}{256}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
