answer: "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand\
  \ the given information:**\n   - The circle has center \\( Q \\) and radius \\(\
  \ 14 \\) inches.\n   - Radii \\( AQ \\) and \\( BQ \\) form a right angle, meaning\
  \ \\( \\angle AQB = 90^\\circ \\).\n   - There are two smaller semicircles tangent\
  \ to each other and to the larger circle.\n\n2. **Visualize the setup:**\n   - The\
  \ larger circle has radius \\( 14 \\).\n   - The two smaller semicircles are tangent\
  \ to each other and to the larger circle. Their diameters lie along \\( AQ \\) and\
  \ \\( BQ \\), respectively.\n\n3. **Let \\( r \\) be the radius of the smaller semicircles:**\n\
  \   - The diameter of each smaller semicircle is \\( 2r \\).\n   - Since the semicircles\
  \ are tangent to the larger circle, the distance from \\( Q \\) to the edge of each\
  \ smaller semicircle is \\( 14 - r \\).\n\n4. **Use the right triangle formed by\
  \ \\( AQ \\), \\( BQ \\), and the line connecting the centers of the smaller semicircles:**\n\
  \   - The centers of the smaller semicircles are located at a distance of \\( r\
  \ \\) from \\( Q \\) along \\( AQ \\) and \\( BQ \\).\n   - The distance between\
  \ the centers of the two smaller semicircles is \\( 2r \\).\n\n5. **Apply the Pythagorean\
  \ theorem:**\n   - The right triangle has legs of length \\( 14 - r \\) and hypotenuse\
  \ \\( 2r \\).\n   - Thus, \\( (14 - r)^2 + (14 - r)^2 = (2r)^2 \\).\n   - Simplify:\
  \ \\( 2(14 - r)^2 = 4r^2 \\).\n   - Divide both sides by 2: \\( (14 - r)^2 = 2r^2\
  \ \\).\n\n6. **Expand and solve for \\( r \\):**\n   - \\( 196 - 28r + r^2 = 2r^2\
  \ \\).\n   - Rearrange: \\( 196 - 28r + r^2 - 2r^2 = 0 \\).\n   - Simplify: \\(\
  \ 196 - 28r - r^2 = 0 \\).\n   - Rearrange: \\( r^2 + 28r - 196 = 0 \\).\n\n7. **Solve\
  \ the quadratic equation:**\n   - Use the quadratic formula: \\( r = \\frac{-b \\\
  pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 28 \\), and \\( c =\
  \ -196 \\).\n   - \\( r = \\frac{-28 \\pm \\sqrt{784 + 784}}{2} \\).\n   - \\( r\
  \ = \\frac{-28 \\pm \\sqrt{1568}}{2} \\).\n   - \\( \\sqrt{1568} = \\sqrt{784 \\\
  cdot 2} = 28\\sqrt{2} \\).\n   - Thus, \\( r = \\frac{-28 \\pm 28\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\
  ).\n   - Simplify: \\( r = -14 \\pm 14\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n8. **Choose the positive\
  \ solution:**\n   - Since \\( r \\) must be positive, \\( r = -14 + 14\\sqrt{2}\
  \ \\).\n   - Factor out \\( 14 \\): \\( r = 14(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\).\n\n9. **Express\
  \ \\( r \\) as a common fraction:**\n   - \\( r = 14(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\).\n   - To\
  \ express this as a common fraction, note that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142 \\\
  ), so \\( r \\approx 14(1.4142 - 1) = 14(0.4142) \\approx 5.8 \\).\n   - However,\
  \ the exact form is \\( r = 14(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\), which is already in its simplest\
  \ form.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\( 14(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\). I hope it\
  \ is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
