answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to convert the decimal number \(629_{10}\)
  to both base 7 and base 8, and then compare the digits in these representations
  to find how many digits are the same.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

  To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7, we repeatedly divide by 7 and record the remainders:

  \[

  629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 6 \\

  89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 5 \\

  12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 5 \\

  1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 1

  \]

  Reading the remainders from bottom to top, \(629_{10}\) in base 7 is \(1556_7\).

  ### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

  To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8, we repeatedly divide by 8 and record the remainders:

  \[

  629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 5 \\

  78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 6 \\

  9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 1 \\

  1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 1

  \]

  Reading the remainders from bottom to top, \(629_{10}\) in base 8 is \(1165_8\).


  ---


  ### Step 3: Compare the digits

  Now we compare the digits of \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):

  - The digits in \(1556_7\) are \(1, 5, 5, 6\).

  - The digits in \(1165_8\) are \(1, 1, 6, 5\).


  The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\). Thus, there are **3** digits in common.

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
  \nProblem:\nHow many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations\
