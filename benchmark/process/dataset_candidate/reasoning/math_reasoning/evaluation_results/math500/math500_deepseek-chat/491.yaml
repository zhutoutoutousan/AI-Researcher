answer: 'To determine the number of different wacky personalities Tom can create for
  Mr. Potato Head, we need to consider the choices available for each feature:


  1. **Hair**: There are 3 hairstyles, but Mr. Potato Head can also be bald. This
  gives us \(3 + 1 = 4\) options.

  2. **Eyebrows**: There are 2 sets of eyebrows, so there are 2 options.

  3. **Eyes**: There is 1 pair of googly eyes, so there is only 1 option.

  4. **Ears**: There are 2 sets of ears, so there are 2 options.

  5. **Lips**: There are 2 sets of lips, so there are 2 options.

  6. **Shoes**: There are 2 pairs of shoes (regular shoes and clown shoes), so there
  are 2 options.


  Since each feature is chosen independently, we multiply the number of options for
  each feature together to find the total number of possible personalities:


  \[

  4 \text{ (hair)} \times 2 \text{ (eyebrows)} \times 1 \text{ (eyes)} \times 2 \text{
  (ears)} \times 2 \text{ (lips)} \times 2 \text{ (shoes)} = 4 \times 2 \times 1 \times
  2 \times 2 \times 2 = 64.

  \]


  Thus, Tom can create **64** different wacky personalities for Mr. Potato Head.


  Final Answer: The final answer is 64. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTom got a Mr. Potato Head for his birthday. It came with 3 hairstyles,\
  \ 2 sets of eyebrows, 1 pair of googly eyes, 2 sets of ears, and 2 sets of lips,\
  \ a pair of regular shoes, and a bonus pair of clown shoes. If a complete Mr. Potato\
  \ Head personality includes eyebrows, eyes, ears, lips, shoes and optionally hair,\
  \ how many different wacky personalities can Tom come up with? Note that Mr. Potato\
  \ Head can be bald.\n\nNote: You cannot \"mix and match\".  For example, you cannot\
  \ take the left eyebrow from one pair and the right eyebrow from the other pair.\n\
  \nPlease given your final answer (answer ONLY) within the format of `Final Answer:\
