answer: "To write the quadratic \\( x^2 + 2.6x + 3.6 \\) in the form \\( (x + b)^2\
  \ + c \\), we complete the square.\n\n1. Start with the quadratic:\n   \\[\n   x^2\
  \ + 2.6x + 3.6\n   \\]\n\n2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient\
  \ of \\( x \\), which is \\( 2.6 \\), and square it:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{2.6}{2}\\\
  right)^2 = 1.3^2 = 1.69\n   \\]\n\n3. Rewrite the quadratic by adding and subtracting\
  \ \\( 1.69 \\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69 - 1.69 + 3.6\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify\
  \ the expression:\n   \\[\n   (x^2 + 2.6x + 1.69) + (3.6 - 1.69)\n   \\]\n\n5. The\
  \ first part is a perfect square:\n   \\[\n   (x + 1.3)^2 + 1.91\n   \\]\n\n6. Thus,\
  \ \\( b = 1.3 \\) and \\( c = 1.91 \\).\n\n7. Finally, compute \\( b + c \\):\n\
  \   \\[\n   b + c = 1.3 + 1.91 = 3.21\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\( 3.21 \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
