answer: 'To find the minimum value of \( a^4 + b^8 \) given the constraint \( ab^2
  = 5 \), we can use the method of **substitution** and **optimization**.


  ### Step 1: Express \( a \) in terms of \( b \)

  From the constraint \( ab^2 = 5 \), we can solve for \( a \):

  \[

  a = \frac{5}{b^2}.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Substitute \( a \) into the expression \( a^4 + b^8 \)

  Substitute \( a = \frac{5}{b^2} \) into \( a^4 + b^8 \):

  \[

  a^4 + b^8 = \left( \frac{5}{b^2} \right)^4 + b^8 = \frac{625}{b^8} + b^8.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Let \( x = b^8 \) and rewrite the expression

  Let \( x = b^8 \). Then the expression becomes:

  \[

  f(x) = \frac{625}{x} + x.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Find the minimum of \( f(x) \)

  To find the minimum of \( f(x) \), take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and
  set it to zero:

  \[

  f''(x) = -\frac{625}{x^2} + 1.

  \]

  Set \( f''(x) = 0 \):

  \[

  -\frac{625}{x^2} + 1 = 0 \implies \frac{625}{x^2} = 1 \implies x^2 = 625 \implies
  x = 25.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Verify that this is a minimum

  The second derivative of \( f(x) \) is:

  \[

  f''''(x) = \frac{1250}{x^3}.

  \]

  Since \( x = 25 \) is positive, \( f''''(x) > 0 \), so \( x = 25 \) corresponds
  to a minimum.


  ### Step 6: Compute the minimum value

  Substitute \( x = 25 \) into \( f(x) \):

  \[

  f(25) = \frac{625}{25} + 25 = 25 + 25 = 50.

  \]


  Thus, the minimum value of \( a^4 + b^8 \) is \( 50 \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 50 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
