answer: "To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes\
  \ and ones, we need to consider the properties of 450 and the constraints on the\
  \ digits.\n\n1. **Factorize 450**:  \n   \\(450 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^2\\).\
  \  \n   This means that any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.\n\
  \n2. **Divisibility rules**:  \n   - A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit\
  \ is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). Since the digits must be 0 or 1, the last digit must\
  \ be 0.  \n   - A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible\
  \ by 9.  \n   - A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50,\
  \ or 75. Since the digits must be 0 or 1, the last two digits must be 00.\n\n3.\
  \ **Construct the number**:  \n   The number must end with 00 to satisfy divisibility\
  \ by 2 and 25. The remaining digits must be 1s, and the total number of 1s must\
  \ be a multiple of 9 to satisfy divisibility by 9. The smallest such number is \\\
  (11111111100\\), which has nine 1s followed by two 0s.\n\n4. **Verify divisibility**:\
  \  \n   - The number \\(11111111100\\) ends with 00, so it is divisible by 2 and\
  \ 25.  \n   - The sum of its digits is \\(9 \\times 1 = 9\\), which is divisible\
  \ by 9.  \n   - Therefore, \\(11111111100\\) is divisible by 450.\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\(11111111100\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
