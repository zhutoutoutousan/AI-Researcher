answer: "To find the minimum value of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) given the condition \\\
  (xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Use the AM-GM Inequality**:\n\
  \   The AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers, the arithmetic mean\
  \ is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. We can apply this to the terms\
  \ \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\n\n2. **Express the Condition**:\n   The given\
  \ condition is \\(xyz(x + y + z) = 1\\). Let \\(S = x + y + z\\). Then, the condition\
  \ becomes \\(xyz \\cdot S = 1\\).\n\n3. **Express \\((x + y)(y + z)\\)**:\n   Expand\
  \ \\((x + y)(y + z)\\):\n   \\[\n   (x + y)(y + z) = xy + xz + y^2 + yz = y(x +\
  \ y + z) + xz = yS + xz.\n   \\]\n   So, \\((x + y)(y + z) = yS + xz\\).\n\n4. **Apply\
  \ AM-GM to \\(yS + xz\\)**:\n   Using the AM-GM inequality on \\(yS\\) and \\(xz\\\
  ):\n   \\[\n   yS + xz \\geq 2\\sqrt{yS \\cdot xz}.\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\(S\
  \ = x + y + z\\) and \\(xyzS = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   yS + xz \\geq 2\\sqrt{yS \\cdot\
  \ xz} = 2\\sqrt{y(x + y + z) \\cdot xz}.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(xyzS = 1\\), we have\
  \ \\(y(x + y + z) \\cdot xz = yS \\cdot xz = 1\\).\n\n5. **Simplify the Inequality**:\n\
  \   \\[\n   yS + xz \\geq 2\\sqrt{1} = 2.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the minimum value\
  \ of \\((x + y)(y + z)\\) is \\(2\\).\n\n6. **Check for Equality**:\n   Equality\
  \ holds when \\(yS = xz\\). Given the condition \\(xyzS = 1\\), equality is achieved\
  \ when \\(x = z\\) and \\(y = \\frac{1}{x^2}\\). Substituting these values into\
  \ the condition confirms that the minimum value is indeed achievable.\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\(2\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
