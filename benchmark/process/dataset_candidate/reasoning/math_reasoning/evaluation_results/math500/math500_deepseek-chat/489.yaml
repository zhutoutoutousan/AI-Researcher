answer: "To determine the minimum value of the function \\( f(x) = |x - p| + |x -\
  \ 15| + |x - p - 15| \\) for \\( x \\) in the interval \\( p \\leq x \\leq 15 \\\
  ), we can analyze the function step by step.\n\n1. **Simplify the Function**:\n\
  \   - Since \\( p \\leq x \\leq 15 \\), we know that \\( x - p \\geq 0 \\) and \\\
  ( 15 - x \\geq 0 \\). Therefore, \\( |x - p| = x - p \\) and \\( |x - 15| = 15 -\
  \ x \\).\n   - The third term \\( |x - p - 15| \\) can be rewritten as \\( |(x -\
  \ 15) - p| \\). Since \\( x \\leq 15 \\), \\( x - 15 \\leq 0 \\), so \\( |x - p\
  \ - 15| = p + 15 - x \\).\n\n2. **Combine the Terms**:\n   - Substituting these\
  \ into the function, we get:\n     \\[\n     f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (p + 15\
  \ - x) = 30 - x.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Find the Minimum Value**:\n   - The function\
  \ \\( f(x) = 30 - x \\) is a linear function that decreases as \\( x \\) increases.\
  \ Therefore, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) in the interval \\( p \\leq x \\\
  leq 15 \\) occurs at the right endpoint \\( x = 15 \\).\n   - Substituting \\( x\
  \ = 15 \\) into the function, we get:\n     \\[\n     f(15) = 30 - 15 = 15.\n  \
  \   \\]\n\nThus, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) in the interval \\( p \\leq x\
  \ \\leq 15 \\) is \\( 15 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $15$. I hope\
  \ it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
