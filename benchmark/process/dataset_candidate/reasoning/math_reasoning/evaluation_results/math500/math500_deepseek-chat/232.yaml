answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the sum:


  \[

  S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} + \dots + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997}},

  \]


  where \(\omega\) is a primitive 1997th root of unity, meaning \(\omega^{1997} =
  1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\).


  ### Step 1: Understanding the roots of unity

  The roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^{1997} = 1\). These roots
  are given by \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, 1996\). Since \(\omega\) is
  a primitive root, \(\omega^k \neq 1\) for \(1 \leq k \leq 1996\).


  ### Step 2: Pairing terms

  Notice that for each term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^k}\), there is a corresponding term
  \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{1997 - k}}\). This is because \(\omega^{1997 - k} = \omega^{-k}\)
  (since \(\omega^{1997} = 1\)).


  ### Step 3: Simplifying the sum

  Consider the sum of a pair of terms:


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-k}}.

  \]


  Using the fact that \(\omega^{-k} = \frac{1}{\omega^k}\), we can rewrite the second
  term as:


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-k}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\omega^k}} = \frac{\omega^k}{\omega^k
  + 1}.

  \]


  Thus, the sum of the pair becomes:


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 + \omega^k} + \frac{\omega^k}{1 + \omega^k} = \frac{1 + \omega^k}{1 +
  \omega^k} = 1.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Counting the pairs

  Since \(\omega\) is a primitive 1997th root of unity, the exponents \(k\) and \(1997
  - k\) are distinct for \(k = 1, 2, \dots, 998\). This means there are 998 such pairs,
  each summing to 1. Additionally, there is one term left unpaired when \(k = 998\),
  which is \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{998}}\).


  ### Step 5: Evaluating the unpaired term

  Since \(\omega^{998} = \omega^{-998}\) (because \(\omega^{1997} = 1\)), we have:


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{998}} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-998}} = 1.

  \]


  Thus, the unpaired term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{998}}\) must satisfy:


  \[

  \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{998}} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^{-998}} = 1.

  \]


  This implies that \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^{998}} = \frac{1}{2}\).


  ### Step 6: Final calculation

  The total sum \(S\) is the sum of the 998 pairs (each equal to 1) plus the unpaired
  term:


  \[

  S = 998 \times 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 998 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1997}{2}.

  \]


  ### Final Answer:

  The final answer is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1997}{2}}\).

  Final Answer: The final answer is $\dfrac{1997}{2}$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
