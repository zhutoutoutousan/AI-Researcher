answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to determine for how many real values of \(
  x \) the expression \( \sqrt{120 - \sqrt{x}} \) is an integer.


  ### Step 1: Let \( \sqrt{120 - \sqrt{x}} = k \), where \( k \) is an integer.

  This implies:

  \[

  120 - \sqrt{x} = k^2.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Solve for \( \sqrt{x} \).

  \[

  \sqrt{x} = 120 - k^2.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Since \( \sqrt{x} \) is a real number, \( 120 - k^2 \geq 0 \).

  This gives:

  \[

  k^2 \leq 120.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Determine the possible integer values of \( k \).

  The largest integer \( k \) such that \( k^2 \leq 120 \) is \( k = 10 \) (since
  \( 10^2 = 100 \leq 120 \)) and the smallest is \( k = -10 \) (since \( (-10)^2 =
  100 \leq 120 \)). However, \( k \) must be non-negative because \( \sqrt{120 - \sqrt{x}}
  \) is a non-negative integer. Thus, \( k \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( 10 \).


  ### Step 5: Count the number of valid \( k \) values.

  The possible values of \( k \) are \( 0, 1, 2, \dots, 10 \), which gives \( 11 \)
  possible values.


  ### Step 6: For each valid \( k \), solve for \( x \).

  For each \( k \) in \( 0, 1, 2, \dots, 10 \), we have:

  \[

  \sqrt{x} = 120 - k^2.

  \]

  Squaring both sides gives:

  \[

  x = (120 - k^2)^2.

  \]

  Since \( k \) is an integer, \( x \) is uniquely determined for each \( k \).


  ### Step 7: Conclusion.

  There are \( 11 \) real values of \( x \) that satisfy the condition.


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 11 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
