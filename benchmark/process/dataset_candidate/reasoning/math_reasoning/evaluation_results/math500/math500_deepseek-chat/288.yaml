answer: 'To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we can use the formula
  for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The formula is:


  \[

  \text{Distance} = \frac{\| \vec{v} \times \vec{P_1P_2} \|}{\| \vec{v} \|}

  \]


  where:

  - \(\vec{v}\) is the direction vector of the lines,

  - \(\vec{P_1P_2}\) is the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point
  on the second line,

  - \(\times\) denotes the cross product,

  - \(\| \cdot \|\) denotes the magnitude of a vector.


  ### Step 1: Identify the direction vector \(\vec{v}\)

  The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\),
  and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4
  \end{pmatrix}\). Notice that the second direction vector is a scalar multiple of
  the first (specifically, \(2 \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\)),
  confirming that the lines are parallel. We can use \(\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2
  \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) as the direction vector.


  ### Step 2: Identify points on each line

  From the first line, a point is \(\vec{P_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).
  From the second line, a point is \(\vec{P_2} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).


  ### Step 3: Compute \(\vec{P_1P_2}\)

  The vector connecting \(\vec{P_1}\) to \(\vec{P_2}\) is:


  \[

  \vec{P_1P_2} = \vec{P_2} - \vec{P_1} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6
  - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Compute the cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{P_1P_2}\)

  The cross product is:


  \[

  \vec{v} \times \vec{P_1P_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \times
  \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]


  Using the cross product formula:


  \[

  \vec{v} \times \vec{P_1P_2} = \begin{pmatrix} (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) \\ (-2)(-8) - (2)(5)
  \\ (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -45 + 14 \\ 16 - 10 \\ 14 -
  72 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Compute the magnitude of \(\vec{v} \times \vec{P_1P_2}\)

  The magnitude is:


  \[

  \| \vec{v} \times \vec{P_1P_2} \| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 +
  36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

  \]


  ### Step 6: Compute the magnitude of \(\vec{v}\)

  The magnitude is:


  \[

  \| \vec{v} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

  \]


  ### Step 7: Compute the distance

  The distance is:


  \[

  \text{Distance} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49}
  = 7.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
