answer: 'To find the equation of the line in the form \( y = mx + b \), we start with
  the parametric equations:


  \[

  x = 8 + 2t

  \]

  \[

  y = -1 + 3t

  \]


  We solve the first equation for \( t \):


  \[

  x = 8 + 2t \implies t = \frac{x - 8}{2}

  \]


  Now substitute this expression for \( t \) into the second equation:


  \[

  y = -1 + 3\left(\frac{x - 8}{2}\right)

  \]


  Simplify the equation:


  \[

  y = -1 + \frac{3(x - 8)}{2}

  \]

  \[

  y = -1 + \frac{3x - 24}{2}

  \]

  \[

  y = \frac{3x - 24}{2} - 1

  \]

  \[

  y = \frac{3x - 24 - 2}{2}

  \]

  \[

  y = \frac{3x - 26}{2}

  \]

  \[

  y = \frac{3}{2}x - 13

  \]


  Thus, the slope \( m \) is \( \frac{3}{2} \) and the y-intercept \( b \) is \( -13
  \). Therefore, the ordered pair \( (m, b) \) is:


  \[

  \left( \frac{3}{2}, -13 \right)

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\left( \frac{3}{2}, -13 \right)\). I hope it
  is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
