answer: "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Alice's first turn:**\n \
  \  - Alice flips a coin. The probability of getting heads (and winning immediately)\
  \ is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - If Alice does not get heads (which happens with\
  \ probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)), the game moves to Bob's turn.\n\n2. **Bob's\
  \ turn:**\n   - Bob flips a coin. The probability of getting tails (and winning\
  \ immediately) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n   - If Bob does not get tails (which happens\
  \ with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)), the game returns to Alice's turn.\n\n\
  3. **Recursive probability:**\n   - Let \\( P \\) be the probability that Alice\
  \ wins the game.\n   - Alice wins immediately with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2}\
  \ \\).\n   - If the game moves to Bob's turn, Alice still has a chance to win. Specifically,\
  \ Bob does not win with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and the game returns to\
  \ Alice's turn, where she again has probability \\( P \\) of winning.\n   - Therefore,\
  \ the recursive equation for \\( P \\) is:\n     \\[\n     P = \\frac{1}{2} + \\\
  frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot P.\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( \\frac{1}{2}\
  \ \\) is the probability that Alice wins on her first turn, and \\( \\frac{1}{2}\
  \ \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot P \\) is the probability that the game returns to Alice's\
  \ turn and she eventually wins.\n\n4. **Solve for \\( P \\):**\n   \\[\n   P = \\\
  frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} P.\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\( \\frac{1}{4} P \\) from both\
  \ sides:\n   \\[\n   P - \\frac{1}{4} P = \\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n   Simplify:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} P = \\frac{1}{2}.\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by \\\
  ( \\frac{4}{3} \\):\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}.\n\
  \   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that Alice wins the game is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\\
  ).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
