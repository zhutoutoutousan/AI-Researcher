answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of sides \( n \) of
  a convex polygon given that the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(
  1070^\circ \).


  ### Step 1: Recall the formula for the sum of interior angles

  The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:

  \[

  \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ

  \]


  ### Step 2: Set up the equation

  If the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \), then the missing
  angle \( x \) satisfies:

  \[

  \text{Sum of all interior angles} = 1070^\circ + x

  \]

  Substitute the formula for the sum of interior angles:

  \[

  (n - 2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x

  \]


  ### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

  Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle \( x \) must satisfy \( 0^\circ
  < x < 180^\circ \). Therefore:

  \[

  x = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ

  \]

  \[

  0^\circ < (n - 2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ

  \]


  ### Step 4: Solve for \( n \)

  First, solve the inequality:

  \[

  1070^\circ < (n - 2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ

  \]

  Divide all parts by \( 180^\circ \):

  \[

  \frac{1070}{180} < n - 2 < \frac{1250}{180}

  \]

  \[

  5.944 < n - 2 < 6.944

  \]

  Add 2 to all parts:

  \[

  7.944 < n < 8.944

  \]

  Since \( n \) must be an integer, the only possible value is \( n = 8 \).


  ### Step 5: Verify the solution

  If \( n = 8 \), the sum of the interior angles is:

  \[

  (8 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ

  \]

  The missing angle \( x \) is:

  \[

  x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ

  \]

  This satisfies \( 0^\circ < x < 180^\circ \), so the solution is valid.


  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 8 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
