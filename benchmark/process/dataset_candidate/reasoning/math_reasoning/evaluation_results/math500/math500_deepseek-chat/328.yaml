answer: "To determine the number of distinct values in the range of the function \\\
  ( f(x) = \\left\\lfloor\\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^x\\right\\rfloor \\), we analyze\
  \ the behavior of \\( \\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^x \\) for \\( x \\in [0, \\infty)\
  \ \\).\n\n1. **Behavior of \\( \\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^x \\):**\n   - For \\\
  ( x = 0 \\), \\( \\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^0 = 1 \\).\n   - For \\( x > 0 \\\
  ), \\( \\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^x \\) oscillates between positive and negative\
  \ values, but its magnitude decreases as \\( x \\) increases because \\( \\left|\\\
  frac{5}{8}\\right| < 1 \\).\n\n2. **Floor Function Analysis:**\n   - The floor function\
  \ \\( \\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor \\) maps a real number to the greatest integer less\
  \ than or equal to it.\n   - As \\( x \\) increases, \\( \\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\\
  right)^x \\) will oscillate between values close to 0, both positive and negative.\n\
  \n3. **Key Observations:**\n   - At \\( x = 0 \\), \\( f(0) = \\lfloor 1 \\rfloor\
  \ = 1 \\).\n   - For \\( x > 0 \\), \\( \\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^x \\) will\
  \ take values in the interval \\( (-1, 1) \\).\n   - The floor of these values will\
  \ be either 0 or -1, depending on whether \\( \\left(-\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^x \\\
  ) is positive or negative.\n\n4. **Distinct Values:**\n   - \\( f(0) = 1 \\).\n\
  \   - For \\( x > 0 \\), \\( f(x) \\) can be either 0 or -1.\n\nThus, the distinct\
  \ values in the range of \\( f(x) \\) are \\( 1, 0, \\) and \\( -1 \\).\n\nFinal\
  \ Answer: The final answer is \\(3\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
