answer: "To solve the problem, we need to factor the polynomial \\( x^8 + 3x^4 - 4\
  \ \\) into irreducible monic polynomials with integer coefficients and then evaluate\
  \ each polynomial at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Factor the polynomial\n\
  Let \\( y = x^4 \\). Then the polynomial becomes:\n\\[\ny^2 + 3y - 4.\n\\]\nThis\
  \ is a quadratic in \\( y \\), which can be factored as:\n\\[\ny^2 + 3y - 4 = (y\
  \ + 4)(y - 1).\n\\]\nSubstituting back \\( y = x^4 \\), we get:\n\\[\nx^8 + 3x^4\
  \ - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^4 - 1).\n\\]\n\nNow, we further factor \\( x^4 - 1 \\):\n\\\
  [\nx^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1).\n\\]\nThe polynomial\
  \ \\( x^4 + 4 \\) is irreducible over the integers because it cannot be factored\
  \ further using integer coefficients.\n\nThus, the complete factorization is:\n\\\
  [\nx^8 + 3x^4 - 4 = (x^4 + 4)(x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1).\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2:\
  \ Evaluate each factor at \\( x = 1 \\)\nNow, evaluate each irreducible polynomial\
  \ at \\( x = 1 \\):\n1. \\( p_1(x) = x^4 + 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   p_1(1) = 1^4 + 4 =\
  \ 1 + 4 = 5.\n   \\]\n2. \\( p_2(x) = x^2 + 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   p_2(1) = 1^2 + 1\
  \ = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   \\]\n3. \\( p_3(x) = x + 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   p_3(1) = 1 + 1 =\
  \ 2.\n   \\]\n4. \\( p_4(x) = x - 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   p_4(1) = 1 - 1 = 0.\n   \\\
  ]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Sum the results\nAdd the values of \\( p_1(1) + p_2(1) +\
  \ p_3(1) + p_4(1) \\):\n\\[\n5 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 9.\n\\]\n\n---\n\nFinal Answer: The\
  \ final answer is $9$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
