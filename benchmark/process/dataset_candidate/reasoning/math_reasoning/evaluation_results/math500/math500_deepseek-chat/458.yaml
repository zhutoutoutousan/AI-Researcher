answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students who showed
  up to the archery class this week, given the constraints:


  1. The number of students is between 30 and 50.

  2. The students cannot be divided into multiple groups of equal size.

  3. Even if Betty and Wilma join the students, the total number of people still cannot
  be divided into groups of equal size.


  ### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

  - The first condition implies that the number of students is a prime number. This
  is because a prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself, so it cannot
  be divided into multiple groups of equal size.

  - The second condition implies that when Betty and Wilma join, the total number
  of people (students + 2) is also a prime number. This is because the total number
  of people still cannot be divided into groups of equal size.


  ### Step 2: List Prime Numbers Between 30 and 50

  The prime numbers between 30 and 50 are:

  - 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.


  ### Step 3: Check Which Prime Number Satisfies Both Conditions

  We need to find a prime number \( p \) such that \( p + 2 \) is also a prime number.


  - \( 31 + 2 = 33 \) (33 is not prime).

  - \( 37 + 2 = 39 \) (39 is not prime).

  - \( 41 + 2 = 43 \) (43 is prime).

  - \( 43 + 2 = 45 \) (45 is not prime).

  - \( 47 + 2 = 49 \) (49 is not prime).


  Only \( 41 \) satisfies both conditions:

  - \( 41 \) is prime.

  - \( 41 + 2 = 43 \) is also prime.


  ### Step 4: Conclusion

  The number of students who showed up to the archery class this week is \( 41 \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is 41. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
  \nProblem:\nEach week, between 30 and 50 students show up for an archery class run\
  \ by Betty and Wilma.  Usually the students break up into groups of equal size for\
  \ target practice.  However, this week, Betty noticed that she could not break the\
  \ students up into multiple groups of equal size.  Wilma noticed that if she and\
  \ Betty both joined the students in practicing, they still could not break the archers\
  \ up into groups of equal size.  How many students showed up to the archery class\
  \ this week?\n\nPlease given your final answer (answer ONLY) within the format of\
