answer: "To solve the problem, we need to compute the correct value of \\(\\frac{-3\
  \ + 4i}{1 + 2i}\\). Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Multiply the numerator\
  \ and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator**:\n   The conjugate of \\\
  (1 + 2i\\) is \\(1 - 2i\\). Multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \\\
  (1 - 2i\\) eliminates the imaginary part in the denominator.\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{-3\
  \ + 4i}{1 + 2i} \\cdot \\frac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \\frac{(-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i)}{(1 + 2i)(1\
  \ - 2i)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand the numerator**:\n   \\[\n   (-3 + 4i)(1 - 2i) =\
  \ (-3)(1) + (-3)(-2i) + (4i)(1) + (4i)(-2i)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = -3 + 6i + 4i -\
  \ 8i^2\n   \\]\n   Since \\(i^2 = -1\\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   -3 + 6i\
  \ + 4i + 8 = 5 + 10i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Expand the denominator**:\n   \\[\n   (1 +\
  \ 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1(1) + 1(-2i) + 2i(1) + 2i(-2i)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 1 - 2i + 2i\
  \ - 4i^2\n   \\]\n   Again, using \\(i^2 = -1\\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n\
  \   1 + 4 = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5 +\
  \ 10i}{5} = 1 + 2i\n   \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(1 + 2i\\).\n\nFinal\
  \ Answer: The final answer is \\(1 + 2i\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
