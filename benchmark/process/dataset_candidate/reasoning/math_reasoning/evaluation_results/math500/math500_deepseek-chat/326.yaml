answer: 'To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin
  (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we can proceed step by step.


  ### Step 1: Let \(\theta = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\phi = \arcsin 0.5\)

  This means:

  \[

  \sin \theta = 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \phi = 0.5.

  \]

  We also know that:

  \[

  \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84}
  = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},

  \]

  \[

  \cos \phi = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75}
  = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Use the sine addition and subtraction formulas

  The sine addition formula is:

  \[

  \sin(\theta + \phi) = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \cos \theta \sin \phi.

  \]

  The sine subtraction formula is:

  \[

  \sin(\theta - \phi) = \sin \theta \cos \phi - \cos \theta \sin \phi.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Compute \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\) and \(\sin(\theta - \phi)\)

  Using the values from Step 1:

  \[

  \sin(\theta + \phi) = (0.4) \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\right)(0.5)
  = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5}.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  \sin(\theta + \phi) = 0.2\sqrt{3} + 0.1\sqrt{21}.

  \]


  Similarly:

  \[

  \sin(\theta - \phi) = (0.4) \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\right)(0.5)
  = \frac{0.4\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{0.5\sqrt{21}}{5}.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  \sin(\theta - \phi) = 0.2\sqrt{3} - 0.1\sqrt{21}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Multiply \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\) and \(\sin(\theta - \phi)\)

  We now multiply the two results:

  \[

  \sin(\theta + \phi) \cdot \sin(\theta - \phi) = (0.2\sqrt{3} + 0.1\sqrt{21})(0.2\sqrt{3}
  - 0.1\sqrt{21}).

  \]

  This is a difference of squares:

  \[

  (0.2\sqrt{3})^2 - (0.1\sqrt{21})^2 = 0.04 \cdot 3 - 0.01 \cdot 21 = 0.12 - 0.21
  = -0.09.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Final Answer

  The value of the expression is \(-0.09\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(-0.09\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
