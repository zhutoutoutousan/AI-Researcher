answer: "To solve this problem, we need to find all two-digit prime numbers where\
  \ the sum of the digits equals 8. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **List\
  \ all two-digit numbers where the sum of the digits is 8:**\n   - The two-digit\
  \ numbers range from 10 to 99.\n   - Let the number be represented as \\(10a + b\\\
  ), where \\(a\\) is the tens digit and \\(b\\) is the units digit.\n   - The condition\
  \ \\(a + b = 8\\) must hold.\n   - Possible pairs \\((a, b)\\) are:\n     - (1,\
  \ 7) \u2192 17\n     - (2, 6) \u2192 26\n     - (3, 5) \u2192 35\n     - (4, 4)\
  \ \u2192 44\n     - (5, 3) \u2192 53\n     - (6, 2) \u2192 62\n     - (7, 1) \u2192\
  \ 71\n     - (8, 0) \u2192 80\n\n2. **Check which of these numbers are prime:**\n\
  \   - **17**: Prime.\n   - **26**: Not prime (divisible by 2 and 13).\n   - **35**:\
  \ Not prime (divisible by 5 and 7).\n   - **44**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 4,\
  \ 11, etc.).\n   - **53**: Prime.\n   - **62**: Not prime (divisible by 2 and 31).\n\
  \   - **71**: Prime.\n   - **80**: Not prime (divisible by 2, 5, etc.).\n\n3. **Count\
  \ the primes:**\n   - The two-digit primes where the sum of the digits is 8 are\
  \ **17, 53, and 71**.\n   - This gives a total of **3** primes.\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
