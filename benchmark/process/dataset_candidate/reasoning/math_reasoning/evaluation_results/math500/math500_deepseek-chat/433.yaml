answer: "To convert \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\) to a terminating decimal, we can perform\
  \ long division of 57 by 160.\n\n1. **Divide 57 by 160:**\n   - 160 goes into 57\
  \ zero times. Add a decimal point and a zero to make it 570.\n   - 160 goes into\
  \ 570 three times (since \\(160 \\times 3 = 480\\)).\n   - Subtract 480 from 570\
  \ to get 90.\n   - Bring down another zero to make it 900.\n   - 160 goes into 900\
  \ five times (since \\(160 \\times 5 = 800\\)).\n   - Subtract 800 from 900 to get\
  \ 100.\n   - Bring down another zero to make it 1000.\n   - 160 goes into 1000 six\
  \ times (since \\(160 \\times 6 = 960\\)).\n   - Subtract 960 from 1000 to get 40.\n\
  \   - Bring down another zero to make it 400.\n   - 160 goes into 400 two times\
  \ (since \\(160 \\times 2 = 320\\)).\n   - Subtract 320 from 400 to get 80.\n  \
  \ - Bring down another zero to make it 800.\n   - 160 goes into 800 five times (since\
  \ \\(160 \\times 5 = 800\\)).\n   - Subtract 800 from 800 to get 0.\n\n2. **Combine\
  \ the results:**\n   - The division process gives us 0.35625.\n\nThus, \\(\\frac{57}{160}\\\
  ) as a terminating decimal is \\(0.35625\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is\
  \ \\(0.35625\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
