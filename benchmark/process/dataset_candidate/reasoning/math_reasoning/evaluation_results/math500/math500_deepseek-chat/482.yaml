answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the reciprocal
  of a randomly selected positive odd integer less than 2010 is a terminating decimal.
  Let''s break this down step by step.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Understand when a reciprocal is a terminating decimal

  A fraction \(\frac{1}{n}\) is a terminating decimal if and only if the prime factors
  of \(n\) are limited to 2 and 5. This is because terminating decimals correspond
  to fractions whose denominators are powers of 10, and 10 factors into \(2 \times
  5\). However, since we are only considering **odd integers**, the denominator \(n\)
  cannot have 2 as a prime factor. Therefore, for \(\frac{1}{n}\) to be a terminating
  decimal, \(n\) must be a power of 5.


  ---


  ### Step 2: Count the number of positive odd integers less than 2010

  The positive odd integers less than 2010 are \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots, 2009\). This is
  an arithmetic sequence where:

  - The first term is \(1\),

  - The common difference is \(2\),

  - The last term is \(2009\).


  The number of terms in this sequence is:

  \[

  \frac{2009 - 1}{2} + 1 = 1005.

  \]

  Thus, there are **1005** positive odd integers less than 2010.


  ---


  ### Step 3: Count the number of positive odd integers less than 2010 that are powers
  of 5

  We need to count the number of odd integers less than 2010 that are powers of 5.
  These are numbers of the form \(5^k\), where \(k\) is a non-negative integer. The
  powers of 5 less than 2010 are:

  \[

  5^0 = 1, \quad 5^1 = 5, \quad 5^2 = 25, \quad 5^3 = 125, \quad 5^4 = 625, \quad
  5^5 = 3125.

  \]

  However, \(5^5 = 3125\) is greater than 2010, so we exclude it. Thus, there are
  **5** such numbers: \(1, 5, 25, 125, 625\).


  ---


  ### Step 4: Compute the probability

  The probability that the reciprocal of a randomly selected positive odd integer
  less than 2010 is a terminating decimal is:

  \[

  \frac{\text{Number of powers of 5 less than 2010}}{\text{Total number of positive
  odd integers less than 2010}} = \frac{5}{1005}.

  \]

  Simplifying this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 5:

  \[

  \frac{5}{1005} = \frac{1}{201}.

  \]

  Thus, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 201\), and \(a + b = 1 + 201 = 202\).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
