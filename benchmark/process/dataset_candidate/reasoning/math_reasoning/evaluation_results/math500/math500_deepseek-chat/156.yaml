answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum angle \(\angle APB\) formed
  by the positions of runners \(A\) and \(B\) as they move along the track, with \(P\)
  being a fixed point perpendicular to the track.


  ### Step 1: Set Up the Problem

  - Let \(O\) be the origin \((0, 0)\).

  - Let \(P\) be the point \((0, 1)\) since \(\overline{OP}\) is perpendicular to
  the track.

  - Let \(A\) and \(B\) be positions on the track at time \(t\). Since \(B\) runs
  three times as fast as \(A\), if \(A\) is at position \((x, 0)\), then \(B\) is
  at position \((3x, 0)\).


  ### Step 2: Express the Coordinates

  - At time \(t\), let \(A\) be at \((x, 0)\) and \(B\) be at \((3x, 0)\).

  - The coordinates of \(P\) are \((0, 1)\).


  ### Step 3: Calculate the Vectors

  - The vector \(\overrightarrow{PA}\) is \((x - 0, 0 - 1) = (x, -1)\).

  - The vector \(\overrightarrow{PB}\) is \((3x - 0, 0 - 1) = (3x, -1)\).


  ### Step 4: Use the Dot Product to Find the Angle

  The angle \(\theta\) between vectors \(\overrightarrow{PA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{PB}\)
  can be found using the dot product formula:

  \[

  \cos \theta = \frac{\overrightarrow{PA} \cdot \overrightarrow{PB}}{|\overrightarrow{PA}|
  \cdot |\overrightarrow{PB}|}

  \]

  First, compute the dot product:

  \[

  \overrightarrow{PA} \cdot \overrightarrow{PB} = x \cdot 3x + (-1) \cdot (-1) = 3x^2
  + 1

  \]

  Next, compute the magnitudes:

  \[

  |\overrightarrow{PA}| = \sqrt{x^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}

  \]

  \[

  |\overrightarrow{PB}| = \sqrt{(3x)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{9x^2 + 1}

  \]

  Thus:

  \[

  \cos \theta = \frac{3x^2 + 1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \cdot \sqrt{9x^2 + 1}}

  \]


  ### Step 5: Maximize the Angle \(\theta\)

  To maximize \(\theta\), we need to minimize \(\cos \theta\). Let \(f(x) = \frac{3x^2
  + 1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1} \cdot \sqrt{9x^2 + 1}}\).


  To find the minimum of \(f(x)\), take the derivative and set it to zero:

  \[

  f''(x) = 0

  \]

  Solving this (which involves some calculus) gives \(x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\).


  Substitute \(x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) into \(f(x)\):

  \[

  f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{3\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 + 1}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2
  + 1} \cdot \sqrt{9\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 + 1}} = \frac{1 + 1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}
  + 1} \cdot \sqrt{3 + 1}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} \cdot 2} = \frac{2}{\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}
  \cdot 2} = \frac{2}{\frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

  \]

  Thus:

  \[

  \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \implies \theta = 30^\circ

  \]


  ### Step 6: Conclusion

  The maximum angle \(\angle APB\) is \(30^\circ\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(30\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
