answer: "To find the maximum value of \\( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\) given the constraint \\\
  ( a + b + c + d = 10 \\), we can use the **weighted AM-GM inequality**. Here's the\
  \ step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Weighted AM-GM Inequality**:\n   The weighted\
  \ AM-GM inequality states that for positive real numbers \\( x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\
  \ \\) and positive weights \\( w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n \\), the following holds:\n\
  \   \\[\n   \\frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\dots + w_n x_n}{w_1 + w_2 + \\dots + w_n}\
  \ \\geq \\left( x_1^{w_1} x_2^{w_2} \\dots x_n^{w_n} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{w_1 + w_2\
  \ + \\dots + w_n}}.\n   \\]\n   Equality occurs when \\( x_1 = x_2 = \\dots = x_n\
  \ \\).\n\n2. **Apply Weighted AM-GM**:\n   Let \\( x_1 = a \\), \\( x_2 = b \\),\
  \ \\( x_3 = c \\), and \\( x_4 = d \\). The weights are \\( w_1 = 1 \\), \\( w_2\
  \ = 2 \\), \\( w_3 = 3 \\), and \\( w_4 = 4 \\), corresponding to the exponents\
  \ in \\( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\). The weighted AM-GM inequality becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\\
  frac{1 \\cdot a + 2 \\cdot b + 3 \\cdot c + 4 \\cdot d}{1 + 2 + 3 + 4} \\geq \\\
  left( a^1 b^2 c^3 d^4 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{1 + 2 + 3 + 4}}.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying\
  \ the denominator, \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{a + 2b + 3c\
  \ + 4d}{10} \\geq \\left( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\right)^{\\frac{1}{10}}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Maximize\
  \ the Expression**:\n   To maximize \\( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\), we need to maximize the\
  \ left-hand side of the inequality. Since \\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\), we can write:\n\
  \   \\[\n   a + 2b + 3c + 4d = a + b + c + d + b + 2c + 3d = 10 + b + 2c + 3d.\n\
  \   \\]\n   The maximum value of \\( a + 2b + 3c + 4d \\) occurs when \\( b \\),\
  \ \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) are as large as possible, but this is constrained by\
  \ \\( a + b + c + d = 10 \\). The optimal case is when \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\\
  ( c \\), and \\( d \\) are proportional to their weights:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{1}{10}\
  \ \\cdot 10 = 1, \\quad b = \\frac{2}{10} \\cdot 10 = 2, \\quad c = \\frac{3}{10}\
  \ \\cdot 10 = 3, \\quad d = \\frac{4}{10} \\cdot 10 = 4.\n   \\]\n   Substituting\
  \ these values into \\( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   ab^2 c^3 d^4 = 1 \\\
  cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 4^4 = 1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 27 \\cdot 256 = 27648.\n   \\\
  ]\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   The maximum value of \\( ab^2 c^3 d^4 \\) is \\( 27648\
  \ \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(27648\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
