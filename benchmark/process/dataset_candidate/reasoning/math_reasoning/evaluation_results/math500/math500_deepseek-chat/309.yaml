answer: "To solve this problem, we need to find a set of distinct positive integers\
  \ whose product is 84 and whose sum is minimized. Let's break this down step by\
  \ step:\n\n1. **Factorize 84**: First, we factorize 84 into its prime factors:\n\
  \   \\[\n   84 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find distinct integer\
  \ combinations**: We need to find distinct positive integers whose product is 84.\
  \ To minimize the sum, we should use the smallest possible distinct integers. Let's\
  \ consider the following combinations:\n   - \\(2, 3, 14\\): The product is \\(2\
  \ \\times 3 \\times 14 = 84\\), and the sum is \\(2 + 3 + 14 = 19\\).\n   - \\(2,\
  \ 6, 7\\): The product is \\(2 \\times 6 \\times 7 = 84\\), and the sum is \\(2\
  \ + 6 + 7 = 15\\).\n   - \\(3, 4, 7\\): The product is \\(3 \\times 4 \\times 7\
  \ = 84\\), and the sum is \\(3 + 4 + 7 = 14\\).\n   - \\(1, 4, 21\\): The product\
  \ is \\(1 \\times 4 \\times 21 = 84\\), and the sum is \\(1 + 4 + 21 = 26\\).\n\
  \   - \\(1, 6, 14\\): The product is \\(1 \\times 6 \\times 14 = 84\\), and the\
  \ sum is \\(1 + 6 + 14 = 21\\).\n   - \\(1, 3, 28\\): The product is \\(1 \\times\
  \ 3 \\times 28 = 84\\), and the sum is \\(1 + 3 + 28 = 32\\).\n\n3. **Identify the\
  \ combination with the smallest sum**: Among the combinations listed above, the\
  \ combination \\(3, 4, 7\\) has the smallest sum, which is 14.\n\nTherefore, the\
  \ least possible sum of the integers is:\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14.\
  \ I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
