answer: 'Let''s solve the problem step by step.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Understand the problem

  We are given an unfair six-sided die with the following properties:

  1. The probability of rolling face \( F \) is greater than \( \frac{1}{6} \).

  2. The probability of rolling the face opposite to \( F \) is less than \( \frac{1}{6}
  \).

  3. The probability of rolling each of the other four faces is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

  4. The sum of the numbers on each pair of opposite faces is 7.


  When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is \( \frac{47}{288}
  \). We are tasked with finding the probability of rolling face \( F \), expressed
  as \( \frac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers, and
  then computing \( m + n \).


  ---


  ### Step 2: Assign probabilities to the faces

  Let the probability of rolling face \( F \) be \( p \). Since the die is unfair,
  \( p > \frac{1}{6} \).


  The face opposite to \( F \) has a probability of \( q \), where \( q < \frac{1}{6}
  \).


  The other four faces each have a probability of \( \frac{1}{6} \).


  Since the probabilities must sum to 1, we have:

  \[

  p + q + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 1.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  p + q + \frac{4}{6} = 1 \implies p + q = 1 - \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}.

  \]


  Thus, \( p + q = \frac{1}{3} \).


  ---


  ### Step 3: Determine the probability of rolling a sum of 7

  When two dice are rolled, the sum of 7 can be achieved in the following ways:

  1. \( (1, 6) \), \( (2, 5) \), \( (3, 4) \), \( (4, 3) \), \( (5, 2) \), \( (6,
  1) \).


  However, since the die is unfair, the probabilities of these outcomes depend on
  the specific faces involved.


  Let \( F \) be the face with probability \( p \), and let its opposite face be \(
  F'' \) with probability \( q \). The other four faces have probability \( \frac{1}{6}
  \).


  The sum of 7 can be achieved in the following cases:

  1. \( (F, F'') \): Probability \( p \cdot q \).

  2. \( (F'', F) \): Probability \( q \cdot p \).

  3. The other four pairs of opposite faces: Each has probability \( \frac{1}{6} \cdot
  \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36} \).


  There are 4 such pairs, so their total contribution is \( 4 \cdot \frac{1}{36} =
  \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9} \).


  Thus, the total probability of rolling a sum of 7 is:

  \[

  2pq + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{47}{288}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Solve for \( p \) and \( q \)

  From \( p + q = \frac{1}{3} \), we can express \( q \) as \( q = \frac{1}{3} - p
  \).


  Substitute \( q = \frac{1}{3} - p \) into the equation \( 2pq + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{47}{288}
  \):

  \[

  2p \left( \frac{1}{3} - p \right) + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{47}{288}.

  \]


  Expand and simplify:

  \[

  2p \cdot \frac{1}{3} - 2p^2 + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{47}{288},

  \]

  \[

  \frac{2p}{3} - 2p^2 + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{47}{288}.

  \]


  Multiply through by 288 to eliminate denominators:

  \[

  288 \cdot \frac{2p}{3} - 288 \cdot 2p^2 + 288 \cdot \frac{1}{9} = 47,

  \]

  \[

  192p - 576p^2 + 32 = 47.

  \]


  Rearrange:

  \[

  -576p^2 + 192p + 32 - 47 = 0,

  \]

  \[

  -576p^2 + 192p - 15 = 0.

  \]


  Multiply through by \(-1\) to simplify:

  \[

  576p^2 - 192p + 15 = 0.

  \]


  Divide through by 3 to simplify further:

  \[

  192p^2 - 64p + 5 = 0.

  \]


  Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

  \[

  p = \frac{64 \pm \sqrt{(-64)^2 - 4 \cdot 192 \cdot 5}}{2 \cdot 192}.

  \]


  Calculate the discriminant:

  \[

  \sqrt{4096 - 3840} = \sqrt{256} = 16.

  \]


  Thus:

  \[

  p = \frac{64 \pm 16}{384}.

  \]


  This gives two solutions:

  \[

  p = \frac{64 + 16}{384} = \frac{80}{384} = \frac{5}{24},

  \]

  \[

  p = \frac{64 - 16}{384} = \frac{48}{384} = \frac{1}{8}.

  \]


  Since \( p > \frac{1}{6} \), we discard \( p = \frac{1}{8} \) (as \( \frac{1}{8}
  < \frac{1}{6} \)) and keep \( p = \frac{5}{24} \).


  ---


  ### Step 5: Verify \( p = \frac{5}{24} \)

  From \( p + q = \frac{1}{3} \), we have:

  \[

  q = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{5}{24} = \frac{8}{24} - \frac{5}{24} = \frac{3}{24} = \frac{1}{8}.

  \]


  Check that \( q < \frac{1}{6} \):

  \[

  \frac{1}{8} < \frac{1}{6}.

  \]


  This satisfies the conditions of the problem.


  ---


  ### Step 6: Compute \( m + n \)

  The probability of rolling face \( F \) is \( p = \frac{5}{24} \). Since \( 5 \)
  and \( 24 \) are coprime, \( m = 5 \) and \( n = 24 \). Thus:

  \[

  m + n = 5 + 24 = 29.

  \]
