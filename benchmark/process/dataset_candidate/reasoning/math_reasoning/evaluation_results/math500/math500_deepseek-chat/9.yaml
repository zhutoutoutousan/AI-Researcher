answer: "To determine how many different values can be obtained from the expression\
  \ \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1\\) by inserting parentheses, we need to consider\
  \ all possible ways to group the multiplication and addition operations. The expression\
  \ has four multiplication operations and one addition operation, and we can insert\
  \ parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the possible\
  \ groupings\nThe expression \\(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1\\) can be grouped\
  \ in various ways by inserting parentheses. The key is to consider all possible\
  \ ways to group the multiplications and the addition.\n\n### Step 2: Enumerate the\
  \ possible groupings\n1. **Group the first two multiplications:**\n   \\[\n   (2\
  \ \\cdot 3) \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\(6 \\cdot 4 \\\
  cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\\).\n\n2. **Group the last two multiplications:**\n \
  \  \\[\n   2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5) + 1\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\\
  (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 20 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\\).\n\n3. **Group the first three multiplications:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4) \\cdot 5 + 1\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\\
  (24 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\\).\n\n4. **Group the last three multiplications:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5) + 1\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\\
  (2 \\cdot 60 + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\\).\n\n5. **Group the addition with the last multiplication:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 5 + 1)\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\\
  (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 21 = 126\\).\n\n6. **Group the addition with the first multiplication:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   (2 \\cdot 3 + 1) \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\\
  (7 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 140\\).\n\n7. **Group the addition with the second multiplication:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   2 \\cdot (3 \\cdot 4 + 1) \\cdot 5\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\\
  (2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5 = 130\\).\n\n8. **Group the addition with the third multiplication:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot (4 + 1) \\cdot 5\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to \\\
  (2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 = 150\\).\n\n### Step 3: List all unique values\n\
  From the above groupings, the unique values obtained are:\n- 121\n- 126\n- 130\n\
  - 140\n- 150\n\n### Step 4: Count the number of unique values\nThere are **5** unique\
  \ values that can be obtained by inserting parentheses into the expression \\(2\
  \ \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(5\\\
  ). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
  \nProblem:\nThe expression $2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 4\\cdot 5+1$ is equal to 121, since\
  \ multiplication is carried out before addition. However, we can obtain values other\
  \ than 121 for this expression if we are allowed to change it by inserting parentheses.\
  \ For example, we can obtain 144 by writing \\[\n(2\\cdot (3\\cdot 4)) \\cdot (5+1)\
  \ = 144.\n\\]In total, how many values can be obtained from the expression $2\\\
  cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + 1$ by inserting parentheses? (Note that rearranging terms\
  \ is not allowed, only inserting parentheses).\n\nPlease given your final answer\
  \ (answer ONLY) within the format of `Final Answer: The final answer is <answer>.\
