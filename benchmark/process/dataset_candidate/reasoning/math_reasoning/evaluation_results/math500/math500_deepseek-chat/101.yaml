answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the reciprocals of the magnitudes
  squared of the roots of the equation:


  \[

  x^{10} + (13x - 1)^{10} = 0.

  \]


  ### Step 1: Rewrite the equation

  The equation can be rewritten as:


  \[

  x^{10} = - (13x - 1)^{10}.

  \]


  Taking the 10th root of both sides, we get:


  \[

  x = \omega_k (13x - 1),

  \]


  where \(\omega_k\) are the 10th roots of \(-1\), i.e., \(\omega_k = e^{i\pi(2k +
  1)/10}\) for \(k = 0, 1, \dots, 9\).


  ### Step 2: Solve for \(x\)

  Rearranging the equation \(x = \omega_k (13x - 1)\), we get:


  \[

  x = 13\omega_k x - \omega_k.

  \]


  Solving for \(x\), we obtain:


  \[

  x(1 - 13\omega_k) = -\omega_k \implies x = \frac{-\omega_k}{1 - 13\omega_k}.

  \]


  Thus, the roots \(r_k\) are given by:


  \[

  r_k = \frac{-\omega_k}{1 - 13\omega_k}.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Compute \(r_k \overline{r_k}\)

  The magnitude squared of \(r_k\) is:


  \[

  r_k \overline{r_k} = \left| \frac{-\omega_k}{1 - 13\omega_k} \right|^2 = \frac{|\omega_k|^2}{|1
  - 13\omega_k|^2}.

  \]


  Since \(|\omega_k| = 1\), this simplifies to:


  \[

  r_k \overline{r_k} = \frac{1}{|1 - 13\omega_k|^2}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Compute the sum of reciprocals

  We need to compute:


  \[

  \sum_{k=1}^5 \frac{1}{r_k \overline{r_k}} = \sum_{k=1}^5 |1 - 13\omega_k|^2.

  \]


  Since \(\omega_k\) are the 10th roots of \(-1\), they come in complex conjugate
  pairs. Thus, we can write:


  \[

  \sum_{k=1}^5 |1 - 13\omega_k|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=0}^9 |1 - 13\omega_k|^2.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Expand the sum

  Expanding \(|1 - 13\omega_k|^2\), we get:


  \[

  |1 - 13\omega_k|^2 = (1 - 13\omega_k)(1 - 13\overline{\omega_k}) = 1 - 13(\omega_k
  + \overline{\omega_k}) + 169|\omega_k|^2.

  \]


  Since \(|\omega_k| = 1\), this simplifies to:


  \[

  |1 - 13\omega_k|^2 = 1 - 13(\omega_k + \overline{\omega_k}) + 169.

  \]


  ### Step 6: Sum over all roots

  The sum over all 10th roots of \(-1\) is:


  \[

  \sum_{k=0}^9 (\omega_k + \overline{\omega_k}) = 0,

  \]


  because the sum of the roots of unity is zero. Therefore:


  \[

  \sum_{k=0}^9 |1 - 13\omega_k|^2 = \sum_{k=0}^9 (1 + 169) = 10 \times 170 = 1700.

  \]


  Thus:


  \[

  \sum_{k=1}^5 |1 - 13\omega_k|^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1700 = 850.

  \]


  ### Final Answer:

  The final answer is \(850\).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
