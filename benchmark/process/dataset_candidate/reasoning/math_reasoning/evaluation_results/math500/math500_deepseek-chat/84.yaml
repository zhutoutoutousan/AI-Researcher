answer: "To find \\( a + b \\), we need to expand the product of the two polynomials\
  \ and then compare the coefficients with the given polynomial.\n\nGiven:\n\\[\n\
  (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\n\\]\n\nLet's expand\
  \ the left-hand side step by step:\n\n1. **Multiply \\( 3t^2 \\) by each term in\
  \ the second polynomial:**\n   \\[\n   3t^2 \\cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n\
  \   3t^2 \\cdot bt = 3bt^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3t^2 \\cdot (-2) = -6t^2\n   \\]\n\
  \n2. **Multiply \\( 5t \\) by each term in the second polynomial:**\n   \\[\n  \
  \ 5t \\cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5t \\cdot bt = 5bt^2\n   \\]\n   \\\
  [\n   5t \\cdot (-2) = -10t\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply \\( a \\) by each term in the\
  \ second polynomial:**\n   \\[\n   a \\cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a \\\
  cdot bt = abt\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   a \\cdot (-2) = -2a\n   \\]\n\nNow, combine all\
  \ these terms:\n\\[\n12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt -\
  \ 2a\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2\
  \ + (-10 + ab)t - 2a\n\\]\n\nNow, compare this with the given polynomial:\n\\[\n\
  12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\n\\]\n\nSet the coefficients equal:\n1. For \\( t^3\
  \ \\):\n   \\[\n   3b + 20 = 26 \\implies 3b = 6 \\implies b = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. For\
  \ \\( t^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   -6 + 5b + 4a = -8\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\( b = 2 \\\
  ):\n   \\[\n   -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \\implies 4a = -12 \\implies a = -3\n   \\]\n\n\
  3. For \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   -10 + ab = -16\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\( a = -3 \\\
  ) and \\( b = 2 \\):\n   \\[\n   -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \\implies -10 - 6 = -16 \\\
  implies -16 = -16\n   \\]\n   This checks out.\n\n4. For the constant term:\n  \
  \ \\[\n   -2a = 6 \\implies -2(-3) = 6 \\implies 6 = 6\n   \\]\n   This also checks\
  \ out.\n\nFinally, \\( a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(-1\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
