answer: 'To solve the problem, we first identify the geometric series:


  \[ 4 + \frac{12}{a} + \frac{36}{a^2} + \cdots \]


  This is a geometric series with the first term \( 4 \) and common ratio \( r = \frac{12/a}{4}
  = \frac{3}{a} \). For the series to converge, the common ratio must satisfy \( |r|
  < 1 \), which implies \( \left|\frac{3}{a}\right| < 1 \). Since \( a \) is a positive
  integer, this simplifies to \( a > 3 \).


  The sum \( S \) of an infinite geometric series is given by:


  \[ S = \frac{\text{First term}}{1 - \text{Common ratio}} = \frac{4}{1 - \frac{3}{a}}
  = \frac{4a}{a - 3} \]


  We are told that the sum \( S \) is a perfect square. Therefore, we require:


  \[ \frac{4a}{a - 3} \]


  to be a perfect square. Let \( k \) be a positive integer such that:


  \[ \frac{4a}{a - 3} = k^2 \]


  Rearranging this equation gives:


  \[ 4a = k^2(a - 3) \]


  \[ 4a = k^2a - 3k^2 \]


  \[ 4a - k^2a = -3k^2 \]


  \[ a(4 - k^2) = -3k^2 \]


  \[ a = \frac{-3k^2}{4 - k^2} \]


  Since \( a \) is a positive integer, the denominator \( 4 - k^2 \) must be negative
  (because the numerator \( -3k^2 \) is negative). This implies:


  \[ 4 - k^2 < 0 \]


  \[ k^2 > 4 \]


  \[ k > 2 \]


  We now test the smallest integer \( k \) greater than 2, which is \( k = 3 \):


  \[ a = \frac{-3(3)^2}{4 - (3)^2} = \frac{-27}{4 - 9} = \frac{-27}{-5} = \frac{27}{5}
  \]


  This is not an integer, so we try \( k = 4 \):


  \[ a = \frac{-3(4)^2}{4 - (4)^2} = \frac{-48}{4 - 16} = \frac{-48}{-12} = 4 \]


  This is an integer, but we must check if \( a > 3 \). Since \( a = 4 > 3 \), this
  is valid. We verify that the sum is a perfect square:


  \[ S = \frac{4a}{a - 3} = \frac{4 \cdot 4}{4 - 3} = \frac{16}{1} = 16 \]


  Indeed, \( 16 \) is a perfect square (\( 4^2 \)). Therefore, the smallest possible
  value of \( a \) is \( 4 \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is $4$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
