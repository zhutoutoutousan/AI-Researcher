answer: "To solve this problem, we will use properties of medians, centroids, and\
  \ similar triangles in triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Centroid:**\n\
  \   - The centroid \\( G \\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, \\(\
  \ AG:GD = 2:1 \\), \\( BG:GE = 2:1 \\), and \\( CG:GF = 2:1 \\).\n\n2. **Parallel\
  \ Line Through \\( G \\):**\n   - The line through \\( G \\) parallel to \\( BC\
  \ \\) intersects \\( AB \\) at \\( M \\) and \\( AC \\) at \\( N \\). Since \\(\
  \ G \\) is the centroid, this line divides \\( AB \\) and \\( AC \\) in the same\
  \ ratio as the medians, which is 2:1.\n\n3. **Area of Triangle \\( ABC \\):**\n\
  \   - The area of triangle \\( ABC \\) is given as 144.\n\n4. **Area of Triangle\
  \ \\( ENG \\):**\n   - Triangle \\( ENG \\) is formed by the centroid \\( G \\),\
  \ the point \\( E \\) (which is the midpoint of \\( AC \\)), and the point \\( N\
  \ \\) (which lies on \\( AC \\) and is determined by the parallel line through \\\
  ( G \\)).\n   - Since \\( G \\) divides the median \\( BE \\) in a 2:1 ratio, and\
  \ \\( E \\) is the midpoint of \\( AC \\), the height of triangle \\( ENG \\) relative\
  \ to \\( EN \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the height of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\
  \   - The base \\( EN \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of the base \\( AC \\) because\
  \ \\( G \\) divides \\( BE \\) in a 2:1 ratio.\n\n5. **Calculating the Area:**\n\
  \   - The area of triangle \\( ENG \\) is proportional to the product of its base\
  \ and height. Since both the base and height are scaled by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)\
  \ and \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) respectively, the area scales by \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\\
  times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{9} \\).\n   - Therefore, the area of triangle \\\
  ( ENG \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{9} \\times 144 = 32 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\( 32 \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
