answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) in the interval
  \([0, 4]\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0, 1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\)
  but \(f(f(x)) = x\).


  Given the function:

  \[

  f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)

  \]


  We need to find \(x\) such that:

  \[

  f(f(x)) = x \quad \text{and} \quad f(x) \neq x

  \]


  First, compute \(f(f(x))\):

  \[

  f(f(x)) = \lambda f(x)(1 - f(x)) = \lambda \left(\lambda x(1 - x)\right) \left(1
  - \lambda x(1 - x)\right)

  \]


  Set \(f(f(x)) = x\):

  \[

  \lambda \left(\lambda x(1 - x)\right) \left(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)\right) = x

  \]


  Simplify the equation:

  \[

  \lambda^2 x(1 - x) \left(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)\right) = x

  \]


  Divide both sides by \(x\) (since \(x \neq 0\)):

  \[

  \lambda^2 (1 - x) \left(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)\right) = 1

  \]


  Expand the left-hand side:

  \[

  \lambda^2 (1 - x) - \lambda^3 x(1 - x)^2 = 1

  \]


  Rearrange the equation:

  \[

  \lambda^2 (1 - x) - 1 = \lambda^3 x(1 - x)^2

  \]


  This equation is complex, so we consider specific values of \(\lambda\) within the
  interval \([0, 4]\) to find solutions.


  We know that for \(\lambda = 0\), \(f(x) = 0\), and \(f(f(x)) = 0\), which does
  not satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\) unless \(x = 0\), but \(f(x) = x\) in this case.


  For \(\lambda = 4\), the function \(f(x) = 4x(1 - x)\) has a fixed point at \(x
  = 0\) and \(x = \frac{3}{4}\). However, \(f(f(x)) = x\) at \(x = \frac{3}{4}\) but
  \(f(x) = x\) at \(x = \frac{3}{4}\), so this does not satisfy the condition \(f(x)
  \neq x\).


  For \(\lambda = 2\), we can check if there exists an \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) =
  x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):

  \[

  f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}

  \]

  Here, \(f(x) = x\), so it does not satisfy the condition.


  For \(\lambda = 3\), let \(x = \frac{2}{3}\):

  \[

  f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 2
  \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}

  \]

  Here, \(f(x) = x\), so it does not satisfy the condition.


  After testing specific values, we find that the only value of \(\lambda\) in the
  interval \([0, 4]\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 4\).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
