answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible values
  of \( x \) such that \( x \geq 2 \), \( y \geq 5 \), and \( x \cdot y = 54 \).


  ### Step 1: Factorize 54

  First, we factorize 54 to find all possible pairs \((x, y)\) where \( x \cdot y
  = 54 \). The factor pairs of 54 are:

  - \( (1, 54) \)

  - \( (2, 27) \)

  - \( (3, 18) \)

  - \( (6, 9) \)

  - \( (9, 6) \)

  - \( (18, 3) \)

  - \( (27, 2) \)

  - \( (54, 1) \)


  ### Step 2: Apply the constraints

  We are given that \( x \geq 2 \) and \( y \geq 5 \). We can eliminate the pairs
  where \( x < 2 \) or \( y < 5 \):

  - \( (1, 54) \) is invalid because \( x = 1 < 2 \).

  - \( (2, 27) \) is valid because \( x = 2 \geq 2 \) and \( y = 27 \geq 5 \).

  - \( (3, 18) \) is valid because \( x = 3 \geq 2 \) and \( y = 18 \geq 5 \).

  - \( (6, 9) \) is valid because \( x = 6 \geq 2 \) and \( y = 9 \geq 5 \).

  - \( (9, 6) \) is valid because \( x = 9 \geq 2 \) and \( y = 6 \geq 5 \).

  - \( (18, 3) \) is invalid because \( y = 3 < 5 \).

  - \( (27, 2) \) is invalid because \( y = 2 < 5 \).

  - \( (54, 1) \) is invalid because \( y = 1 < 5 \).


  ### Step 3: Count the valid values of \( x \)

  The valid pairs are \( (2, 27) \), \( (3, 18) \), \( (6, 9) \), and \( (9, 6) \).
  Thus, the possible values of \( x \) are \( 2, 3, 6, \) and \( 9 \).


  ### Final Answer

  There are **4** possible values of \( x \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
