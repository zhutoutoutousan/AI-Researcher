answer: "To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive perfect cube\
  \ that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers. Let's break it down\
  \ step by step:\n\n1. **Represent the sum of three consecutive integers:**\n   Let\
  \ the three consecutive integers be \\( n-1 \\), \\( n \\), and \\( n+1 \\). Their\
  \ sum is:\n   \\[\n   (n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n.\n   \\]\n   So, the sum of three consecutive\
  \ integers is \\( 3n \\).\n\n2. **Set the sum equal to a perfect cube:**\n   We\
  \ want \\( 3n \\) to be a perfect cube. Let \\( 3n = k^3 \\), where \\( k \\) is\
  \ a positive integer. Solving for \\( n \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{k^3}{3}.\n\
  \   \\]\n   Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, \\( k^3 \\) must be divisible by\
  \ 3. This means \\( k \\) must be divisible by 3 (because 3 is a prime number, and\
  \ for \\( k^3 \\) to be divisible by 3, \\( k \\) itself must be divisible by 3).\n\
  \n3. **Find the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\) is divisible by 3:**\n  \
  \ The smallest positive integer \\( k \\) divisible by 3 is \\( k = 3 \\). Substituting\
  \ \\( k = 3 \\) into \\( 3n = k^3 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   3n = 3^3 = 27 \\implies\
  \ n = 9.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \\( 8 \\), \\\
  ( 9 \\), and \\( 10 \\), and their sum is \\( 27 \\), which is a perfect cube.\n\
  \n4. **Verify that 27 is the smallest positive perfect cube:**\n   The next possible\
  \ value for \\( k \\) is 6, which would give \\( 3n = 6^3 = 216 \\), but this is\
  \ larger than 27. Therefore, 27 is indeed the smallest positive perfect cube that\
  \ can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers.\n\nFinal Answer: The\
  \ final answer is \\( 27 \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
