answer: "To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rewrite the ellipse\
  \ equation**: The given ellipse equation is \\( kx^2 + y^2 = 1 \\). We can rewrite\
  \ this in the standard form of an ellipse:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2}\
  \ = 1,\n   \\]\n   where \\( a^2 = \\frac{1}{k} \\) and \\( b^2 = 1 \\). Since \\\
  ( k > 1 \\), we have \\( a < b \\), meaning the major axis is along the \\( y \\\
  )-axis.\n\n2. **Find the foci of the ellipse**: For an ellipse of the form \\( \\\
  frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \\), the distance of each focus from the center\
  \ is given by \\( c = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2} \\). Substituting \\( a^2 = \\frac{1}{k}\
  \ \\) and \\( b^2 = 1 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{k}}.\n \
  \  \\]\n   The foci are located at \\( (0, c) \\) and \\( (0, -c) \\).\n\n3. **Find\
  \ the equation of the circle**: The circle passes through the foci \\( (0, c) \\\
  ) and \\( (0, -c) \\), and it is tangent to the ellipse at two points on the \\\
  ( x \\)-axis. The center of the circle must lie on the \\( y \\)-axis due to symmetry.\
  \ Let the center of the circle be \\( (0, h) \\), and its radius \\( r \\). The\
  \ equation of the circle is:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + (y - h)^2 = r^2.\n   \\]\n   Since\
  \ the circle passes through \\( (0, c) \\) and \\( (0, -c) \\), we have:\n   \\\
  [\n   (0)^2 + (c - h)^2 = r^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (0)^2 + (-c - h)^2 = r^2.\n\
  \   \\]\n   These equations simplify to:\n   \\[\n   (c - h)^2 = r^2 \\quad \\text{and}\
  \ \\quad (c + h)^2 = r^2.\n   \\]\n   Setting them equal, we get:\n   \\[\n   (c\
  \ - h)^2 = (c + h)^2.\n   \\]\n   Expanding both sides:\n   \\[\n   c^2 - 2ch +\
  \ h^2 = c^2 + 2ch + h^2.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   -2ch = 2ch\
  \ \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad -4ch = 0.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( c \\neq 0 \\), we must\
  \ have \\( h = 0 \\). Thus, the center of the circle is at \\( (0, 0) \\), and the\
  \ radius \\( r = c \\). The equation of the circle is:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 = c^2.\n\
  \   \\]\n\n4. **Tangency condition**: The circle is tangent to the ellipse at two\
  \ points on the \\( x \\)-axis. The points of tangency on the \\( x \\)-axis are\
  \ \\( (a, 0) \\) and \\( (-a, 0) \\). Substituting \\( (a, 0) \\) into the circle's\
  \ equation:\n   \\[\n   a^2 + 0^2 = c^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a^2 = c^2.\n\
  \   \\]\n   Recall that \\( a^2 = \\frac{1}{k} \\) and \\( c^2 = 1 - \\frac{1}{k}\
  \ \\). Thus:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{k} = 1 - \\frac{1}{k}.\n   \\]\n   Solving for\
  \ \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{k} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\\
  quad \\frac{2}{k} = 1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = 2.\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\( 2 \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
