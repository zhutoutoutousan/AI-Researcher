answer: 'To solve the equation:

  \[

  \sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3},

  \]

  we proceed step by step.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Simplify the expression inside the sine function

  Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then:

  \[

  \tan(\theta) = x.

  \]

  We also know that:

  \[

  \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x),

  \]

  because \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is the angle whose cotangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\),
  which is equivalent to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus:

  \[

  \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \theta + \theta = 2\theta.

  \]

  The equation becomes:

  \[

  \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.

  \]

  ### Step 2: Solve for \(\theta\)

  We know that:

  \[

  \sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.

  \]

  From \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\)
  in terms of \(x\):

  \[

  \sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}, \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 +
  x^2}}.

  \]

  Substituting these into the equation:

  \[

  2 \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} = \frac{1}{3}.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  \frac{2x}{1 + x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)

  Multiply both sides by \(1 + x^2\):

  \[

  2x = \frac{1 + x^2}{3}.

  \]

  Multiply both sides by 3:

  \[

  6x = 1 + x^2.

  \]

  Rearrange:

  \[

  x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.

  \]

  Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

  \[

  x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}
  = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Verify the solutions

  Both \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) satisfy the original equation.

  Final Answer: The final answer is \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}, 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). I hope it is
  correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
