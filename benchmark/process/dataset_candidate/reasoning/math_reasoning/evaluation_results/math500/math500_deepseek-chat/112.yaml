answer: 'To simplify the expression \(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2+\sqrt{3}}\), we rationalize
  the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate
  of the denominator, which is \(2 - \sqrt{3}\). This gives:


  \[

  \frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2+\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{2-\sqrt{3}}{2-\sqrt{3}} = \frac{(1+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{3})}{(2+\sqrt{3})(2-\sqrt{3})}.

  \]


  First, simplify the denominator:


  \[

  (2+\sqrt{3})(2-\sqrt{3}) = 2^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1.

  \]


  Next, expand the numerator:


  \[

  (1+\sqrt{2})(2-\sqrt{3}) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot (-\sqrt{3}) + \sqrt{2} \cdot 2 +
  \sqrt{2} \cdot (-\sqrt{3}).

  \]


  This simplifies to:


  \[

  2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}.

  \]


  Thus, the expression becomes:


  \[

  2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}.

  \]


  We are asked to rewrite this in the form \(A(1+\sqrt{B}) - (\sqrt{C} + \sqrt{D})\).
  Comparing the terms, we can see that:


  \[

  2 - \sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6} = 2(1 + \sqrt{2}) - (\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6}).

  \]


  Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = 2\), \(C = 3\), and \(D = 6\). Therefore, the sum \(A + B
  + C + D\) is:


  \[

  2 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 13.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is $13$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
