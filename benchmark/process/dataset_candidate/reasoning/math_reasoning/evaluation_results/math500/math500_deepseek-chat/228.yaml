answer: "To solve the problem, we need to find the region of the volume enclosed by\
  \ the set of points \\( P \\) such that the sum of the squares of their distances\
  \ to the three given planes is equal to 36.\n\n### Step 1: Distance Formula\nThe\
  \ distance \\( d \\) from a point \\( P(x, y, z) \\) to a plane \\( Ax + By + Cz\
  \ + D = 0 \\) is given by:\n\\[\nd = \\frac{|Ax + By + Cz + D|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2\
  \ + C^2}}.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Distances to the Given Planes\n1. **Plane 1:** \\\
  ( x - z = 0 \\)  \n   The distance \\( d_1 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   d_1 = \\frac{|x -\
  \ z|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{|x - z|}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Plane\
  \ 2:** \\( x - 2y + z = 0 \\)  \n   The distance \\( d_2 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   d_2\
  \ = \\frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\\sqrt{6}}.\n\
  \   \\]\n\n3. **Plane 3:** \\( x + y + z = 0 \\)  \n   The distance \\( d_3 \\)\
  \ is:\n   \\[\n   d_3 = \\frac{|x + y + z|}{\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \\frac{|x\
  \ + y + z|}{\\sqrt{3}}.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Sum of Squares of Distances\nThe\
  \ condition \\( d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 = 36 \\) becomes:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{|x -\
  \ z|}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{|x - 2y + z|}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right)^2 +\
  \ \\left(\\frac{|x + y + z|}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = 36.\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\
  \\[\n\\frac{(x - z)^2}{2} + \\frac{(x - 2y + z)^2}{6} + \\frac{(x + y + z)^2}{3}\
  \ = 36.\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Equation\nMultiply through by 6 to eliminate\
  \ denominators:\n\\[\n3(x - z)^2 + (x - 2y + z)^2 + 2(x + y + z)^2 = 216.\n\\]\n\
  Expanding each term:\n\\[\n3(x^2 - 2xz + z^2) + (x^2 - 4xy + 2xz - 4y^2 + 4yz +\
  \ z^2) + 2(x^2 + 2xy + 2xz + y^2 + 2yz + z^2) = 216.\n\\]\nCombine like terms:\n\
  \\[\n3x^2 - 6xz + 3z^2 + x^2 - 4xy + 2xz - 4y^2 + 4yz + z^2 + 2x^2 + 4xy + 4xz +\
  \ 2y^2 + 4yz + 2z^2 = 216.\n\\]\nSimplify further:\n\\[\n6x^2 + 6z^2 - 2y^2 + 8yz\
  \ + 0xy + 0xz = 216.\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n6x^2 - 2y^2 + 6z^2 + 8yz =\
  \ 216.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Recognize the Shape\nThe equation \\( 6x^2 - 2y^2 + 6z^2\
  \ + 8yz = 216 \\) represents a quadric surface. To find the volume enclosed by this\
  \ surface, we can rewrite it in standard form.\n\n### Step 6: Volume Calculation\n\
  The volume enclosed by a quadric surface of the form \\( Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2 + Dyz\
  \ = K \\) can be found using the determinant of the associated matrix. However,\
  \ in this case, the volume is finite and can be calculated using the formula for\
  \ the volume of an ellipsoid.\n\nThe standard form of an ellipsoid is:\n\\[\n\\\
  frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} + \\frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1.\n\\]\nComparing this with\
  \ our equation, we can see that the volume enclosed by \\( S \\) is finite and corresponds\
  \ to an ellipsoid.\n\n### Step 7: Final Answer\nThe volume enclosed by \\( S \\\
  ) is finite and corresponds to an ellipsoid. The exact volume can be calculated\
  \ using the standard formula for the volume of an ellipsoid, but the problem asks\
  \ for the region of the volume enclosed by \\( S \\), which is an ellipsoid.\n\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is an ellipsoid. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
