answer: "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\
  \n1. **Given Information**:\n   - \\( AD = BD = CD \\). This means that point \\\
  ( D \\) is equidistant from points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\). Therefore,\
  \ \\( D \\) is the circumcenter of triangle \\( ABC \\).\n   - \\( \\angle BCA =\
  \ 40^\\circ \\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Circumcenter**:\n   - Since \\( D \\\
  ) is the circumcenter of triangle \\( ABC \\), it lies at the intersection of the\
  \ perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle.\n   - The circumradius \\\
  ( R \\) is the distance from \\( D \\) to any of the vertices \\( A \\), \\( B \\\
  ), or \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Using the Circumradius and Central Angles**:\n   - The\
  \ central angle \\( \\angle BDC \\) is twice the inscribed angle \\( \\angle BAC\
  \ \\). This is a property of circles: the central angle is twice the inscribed angle\
  \ that subtends the same arc.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\angle BDC = 2 \\cdot \\angle\
  \ BAC \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing Triangle \\( BDC \\)**:\n   - In triangle \\( BDC \\\
  ), since \\( BD = CD \\), the triangle is isosceles with \\( BD = CD \\).\n   -\
  \ The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal. Therefore, \\( \\angle DBC\
  \ = \\angle DCB \\).\n   - We know that \\( \\angle BCA = 40^\\circ \\), so \\(\
  \ \\angle DCB = 40^\\circ \\).\n   - The sum of angles in triangle \\( BDC \\) is\
  \ \\( 180^\\circ \\), so:\n     \\[\n     \\angle DBC + \\angle DCB + \\angle BDC\
  \ = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n     Substituting the known values:\n     \\[\n     40^\\\
  circ + 40^\\circ + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( \\angle\
  \ BDC \\):\n     \\[\n     \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ - 80^\\circ = 100^\\circ\n \
  \    \\]\n\n5. **Relating \\( \\angle BDC \\) to \\( \\angle BAC \\)**:\n   - Since\
  \ \\( \\angle BDC = 2 \\cdot \\angle BAC \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     100^\\circ\
  \ = 2 \\cdot \\angle BAC\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( \\angle BAC \\):\n    \
  \ \\[\n     \\angle BAC = \\frac{100^\\circ}{2} = 50^\\circ\n     \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\(50^\\circ\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
