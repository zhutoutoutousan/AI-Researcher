answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine when both gears will have their\
  \ marks pointing due north at the same time again. This occurs when both gears have\
  \ completed an integer number of full rotations, bringing their marks back to the\
  \ north position simultaneously.\n\n### Step 1: Convert the rotation rates to rotations\
  \ per second\n- The first gear turns \\( 33\\frac{1}{3} \\) times per minute. This\
  \ is equivalent to \\( \\frac{100}{3} \\) rotations per minute. To convert this\
  \ to rotations per second, divide by 60:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{100}{3} \\div 60 = \\\
  frac{100}{180} = \\frac{5}{9} \\text{ rotations per second.}\n  \\]\n\n- The second\
  \ gear turns 45 times per minute. To convert this to rotations per second, divide\
  \ by 60:\n  \\[\n  45 \\div 60 = \\frac{3}{4} \\text{ rotations per second.}\n \
  \ \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the time when both gears complete an integer number of\
  \ rotations\nLet \\( t \\) be the time in seconds when both gears have their marks\
  \ pointing due north again. For this to happen:\n- The first gear must complete\
  \ \\( \\frac{5}{9} \\cdot t \\) rotations, which must be an integer.\n- The second\
  \ gear must complete \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot t \\) rotations, which must also be\
  \ an integer.\n\nThus, \\( t \\) must satisfy:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{9} \\cdot t \\in\
  \ \\mathbb{Z} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot t \\in \\mathbb{Z}.\n\
  \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators\nThe\
  \ denominators are 9 and 4. The least common multiple of 9 and 4 is 36. Therefore,\
  \ \\( t \\) must be a multiple of 36 to satisfy both conditions.\n\n### Step 4:\
  \ Verify the solution\n- For the first gear:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5}{9} \\cdot 36 =\
  \ 20 \\text{ rotations, which is an integer.}\n  \\]\n\n- For the second gear:\n\
  \  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 36 = 27 \\text{ rotations, which is also an integer.}\n\
  \  \\]\n\nThus, \\( t = 36 \\) seconds is the smallest time when both gears will\
  \ have their marks pointing due north again.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is\
  \ \\(36\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
