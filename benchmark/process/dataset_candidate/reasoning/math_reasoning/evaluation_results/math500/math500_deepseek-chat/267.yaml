answer: "To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\
  \n1. **Understanding the problem**:\n   - Circle \\( J \\) has two tangent lines\
  \ \\( HO \\) and \\( HN \\) touching the circle at points \\( O \\) and \\( N \\\
  ), respectively.\n   - We are asked to find the sum of the measures of angles \\\
  ( \\angle J \\) and \\( \\angle H \\).\n\n2. **Key properties**:\n   - A tangent\
  \ to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore,\
  \ \\( JO \\) is perpendicular to \\( HO \\), and \\( JN \\) is perpendicular to\
  \ \\( HN \\).\n   - This means \\( \\angle JOH = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle JNH\
  \ = 90^\\circ \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing quadrilateral \\( JOH \\)**:\n   - In quadrilateral\
  \ \\( JOH \\), the sum of the interior angles is \\( 360^\\circ \\).\n   - We know\
  \ \\( \\angle JOH = 90^\\circ \\) and \\( \\angle JHO = 90^\\circ \\) (since \\\
  ( HO \\) is tangent to the circle at \\( O \\)).\n   - Let \\( \\angle J = x \\\
  ) and \\( \\angle H = y \\). Then, the sum of the angles in quadrilateral \\( JOH\
  \ \\) is:\n     \\[\n     x + y + 90^\\circ + 90^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n     \\]\n\
  \     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     x + y = 180^\\circ\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n\
  \   - The sum of \\( m\\angle J \\) and \\( m\\angle H \\) is \\( 180^\\circ \\\
  ).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(180^\\circ\\). I hope it is correct."
gt_answer: 180^\circ
prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
