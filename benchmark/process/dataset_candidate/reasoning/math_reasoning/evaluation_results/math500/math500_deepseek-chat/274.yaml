answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the perimeter of the set \( S
  \), which is the union of the set of all points inside a regular nonagon with side
  length 2 units and the set of all points less than 1 unit away from a point on the
  perimeter of the nonagon.


  ### Step 1: Understand the shape of \( S \)

  The set \( S \) consists of:

  1. The interior of a regular nonagon with side length 2 units.

  2. A "buffer zone" around the perimeter of the nonagon, where every point is within
  1 unit of the perimeter.


  This buffer zone effectively adds a semicircular "cap" of radius 1 unit to each
  side of the nonagon. Since the nonagon has 9 sides, there will be 9 such semicircular
  caps.


  ### Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the original nonagon

  A regular nonagon has 9 sides, each of length 2 units. Therefore, the perimeter
  of the original nonagon is:

  \[

  \text{Perimeter of nonagon} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ units}.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Calculate the perimeter added by the semicircular caps

  Each semicircular cap has a radius of 1 unit. The circumference of a full circle
  with radius 1 is \( 2\pi \), so the circumference of a semicircle is \( \pi \).
  Since there are 9 such semicircular caps, the total additional perimeter from the
  caps is:

  \[

  \text{Perimeter from caps} = 9 \times \pi = 9\pi \text{ units}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Total perimeter of \( S \)

  The total perimeter of \( S \) is the sum of the perimeter of the original nonagon
  and the perimeter added by the semicircular caps:

  \[

  \text{Total perimeter of } S = 18 + 9\pi \text{ units}.

  \]


  ### Final Answer:

  The perimeter of \( S \) is \( 18 + 9\pi \) units.


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(18 + 9\pi\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
