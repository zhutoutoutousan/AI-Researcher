answer: 'To find the smallest possible value of \( a \) such that all the roots of
  the cubic equation

  \[

  x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0

  \]

  are real, we can proceed with the following steps:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Analyze the equation

  The given cubic equation is:

  \[

  x^3 + ax^2 + ax + 1 = 0.

  \]

  We want all three roots of this equation to be real. For a cubic equation of the
  form \( x^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \), the condition for all roots to be real is that
  the discriminant \( \Delta \) must satisfy \( \Delta \geq 0 \). However, calculating
  the discriminant for this specific equation is tedious, so we will use an alternative
  approach.


  ---


  ### Step 2: Use symmetry to simplify

  Notice that the equation can be rewritten as:

  \[

  x^3 + 1 + a(x^2 + x) = 0.

  \]

  This suggests that \( x = -1 \) might be a root. Let us test this:

  \[

  (-1)^3 + a(-1)^2 + a(-1) + 1 = -1 + a - a + 1 = 0.

  \]

  Thus, \( x = -1 \) is indeed a root of the equation.


  ---


  ### Step 3: Factor the equation

  Since \( x = -1 \) is a root, we can factor the equation as:

  \[

  (x + 1)(x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1) = 0.

  \]

  The quadratic factor is:

  \[

  x^2 + (a - 1)x + 1 = 0.

  \]

  For all roots to be real, the quadratic must also have real roots. This requires
  its discriminant \( D \) to satisfy \( D \geq 0 \):

  \[

  D = (a - 1)^2 - 4(1)(1) \geq 0.

  \]

  Simplify:

  \[

  (a - 1)^2 - 4 \geq 0.

  \]

  \[

  (a - 1)^2 \geq 4.

  \]

  \[

  |a - 1| \geq 2.

  \]

  This gives two cases:

  1. \( a - 1 \geq 2 \), so \( a \geq 3 \).

  2. \( a - 1 \leq -2 \), so \( a \leq -1 \).


  Since \( a \) is a positive real number, we discard \( a \leq -1 \) and conclude
  \( a \geq 3 \).


  ---


  ### Step 4: Verify the minimum value

  The smallest possible value of \( a \) is \( a = 3 \). To verify, substitute \(
  a = 3 \) into the original equation:

  \[

  x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0.

  \]

  Factor:

  \[

  (x + 1)^3 = 0.

  \]

  This has a triple root at \( x = -1 \), which is real. Thus, \( a = 3 \) satisfies
  the condition.

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
