answer: "To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph\
  \ of \\( y = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9 \\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Distance\
  \ Formula**: The distance \\( D \\) between the origin \\((0, 0)\\) and a point\
  \ \\((x, y)\\) on the graph is given by:\n   \\[\n   D = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.\n  \
  \ \\]\n   Since \\( y = \\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9 \\), we can substitute this into the\
  \ distance formula:\n   \\[\n   D = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\\right)^2}.\n\
  \   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the Expression**: To minimize \\( D \\), it is equivalent\
  \ to minimize \\( D^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   D^2 = x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - 9\\\
  right)^2.\n   \\]\n   Expand the squared term:\n   \\[\n   D^2 = x^2 + \\left(\\\
  frac{1}{4}x^4 - 9x^2 + 81\\right).\n   \\]\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   D^2\
  \ = \\frac{1}{4}x^4 - 8x^2 + 81.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Minimize \\( D^2 \\)**: To find\
  \ the minimum value of \\( D^2 \\), take the derivative of \\( D^2 \\) with respect\
  \ to \\( x \\) and set it to zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}x^4\
  \ - 8x^2 + 81\\right) = x^3 - 16x.\n   \\]\n   Set the derivative equal to zero:\n\
  \   \\[\n   x^3 - 16x = 0 \\implies x(x^2 - 16) = 0.\n   \\]\n   The solutions are\
  \ \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = \\pm 4 \\). Since \\( x = 0 \\) would give \\( y = -9\
  \ \\), which is not the closest point, we consider \\( x = \\pm 4 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate\
  \ \\( D^2 \\) at \\( x = \\pm 4 \\)**: Substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into \\( D^2 \\\
  ):\n   \\[\n   D^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(4)^4 - 8(4)^2 + 81 = \\frac{1}{4}(256) - 8(16)\
  \ + 81 = 64 - 128 + 81 = 17.\n   \\]\n   The same result holds for \\( x = -4 \\\
  ).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The smallest distance squared is \\( a^2 = 17 \\).\n\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is \\(17\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
