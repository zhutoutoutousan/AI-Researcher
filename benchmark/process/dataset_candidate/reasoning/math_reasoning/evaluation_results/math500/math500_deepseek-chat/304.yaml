answer: "To find the minimum value of the expression \\(\\frac{(x + 5)(x + 2)}{x +\
  \ 1}\\) for \\(x > 0\\), we can proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Simplify\
  \ the Expression:**\n   Expand the numerator:\n   \\[\n   (x + 5)(x + 2) = x^2 +\
  \ 7x + 10.\n   \\]\n   So the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2 + 7x +\
  \ 10}{x + 1}.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perform Polynomial Division:**\n   Divide \\(x^2 +\
  \ 7x + 10\\) by \\(x + 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x^2 + 7x + 10}{x + 1} = x + 6 +\
  \ \\frac{4}{x + 1}.\n   \\]\n   Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n   \\[\n  \
  \ x + 6 + \\frac{4}{x + 1}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Critical Points:**\n   To find\
  \ the minimum value, take the derivative of the expression with respect to \\(x\\\
  ) and set it to zero:\n   \\[\n   f(x) = x + 6 + \\frac{4}{x + 1}.\n   \\]\n   The\
  \ derivative is:\n   \\[\n   f'(x) = 1 - \\frac{4}{(x + 1)^2}.\n   \\]\n   Set \\\
  (f'(x) = 0\\):\n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{4}{(x + 1)^2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{4}{(x +\
  \ 1)^2} = 1 \\implies (x + 1)^2 = 4.\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n\
  \   x + 1 = 2 \\implies x = 1.\n   \\]\n   (We discard \\(x + 1 = -2\\) since \\\
  (x > 0\\).)\n\n4. **Verify the Minimum:**\n   Substitute \\(x = 1\\) into the original\
  \ expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(1 + 5)(1 + 2)}{1 + 1} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 3}{2}\
  \ = 9.\n   \\]\n   To confirm this is the minimum, observe that the second derivative\
  \ \\(f''(x)\\) is positive for \\(x > 0\\), indicating a local minimum.\n\nThus,\
  \ the minimum value of the expression is \\(\\boxed{9}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The\
  \ final answer is $9$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
