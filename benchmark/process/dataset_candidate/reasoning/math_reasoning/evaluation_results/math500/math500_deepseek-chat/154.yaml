answer: "To find the shortest path the gecko can take to reach the fly, we can \"\
  unfold\" the room into a 2D plane. This allows us to represent the walls, ceiling,\
  \ and floor as a flat surface, making it easier to calculate the straight-line distance\
  \ between the gecko and the fly.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the room dimensions and\
  \ positions\n- The room is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 8 feet tall.\n- The gecko\
  \ is on a side wall (10' by 8'), 1 foot from the ceiling and 1 foot from the back\
  \ wall (12' by 8').\n- The fly is on the opposite side wall, 1 foot from the floor\
  \ and 1 foot from the front wall.\n\n### Step 2: Unfold the room\nWe can unfold\
  \ the room in such a way that the gecko's starting point and the fly's position\
  \ lie on the same 2D plane. One possible unfolding is:\n- Start with the side wall\
  \ where the gecko is located (10' by 8').\n- Attach the ceiling (12' by 10') to\
  \ the top of this wall.\n- Attach the opposite side wall (10' by 8') to the right\
  \ of the ceiling.\n\nThis creates a 2D plane with dimensions 22' (10' + 12') by\
  \ 8'.\n\n### Step 3: Locate the gecko and the fly on the 2D plane\n- The gecko is\
  \ 1 foot from the ceiling and 1 foot from the back wall. On the unfolded plane,\
  \ this corresponds to coordinates (1, 7) because:\n  - The horizontal distance from\
  \ the left edge is 1 foot (1 foot from the back wall).\n  - The vertical distance\
  \ from the bottom is 7 feet (1 foot from the ceiling on an 8-foot wall).\n\n- The\
  \ fly is 1 foot from the floor and 1 foot from the front wall. On the unfolded plane,\
  \ this corresponds to coordinates (11, 1) because:\n  - The horizontal distance\
  \ from the left edge is 11 feet (1 foot from the front wall on the opposite side).\n\
  \  - The vertical distance from the bottom is 1 foot (1 foot from the floor).\n\n\
  ### Step 4: Calculate the straight-line distance\nThe straight-line distance between\
  \ the gecko at (1, 7) and the fly at (11, 1) can be calculated using the distance\
  \ formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\n\\\
  ]\n\nSubstituting the coordinates:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Distance} = \\sqrt{(11 - 1)^2\
  \ + (1 - 7)^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 + (-6)^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 36} = \\sqrt{136} = 2\\sqrt{34}\n\
  \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(2\\sqrt{34}\\). I\
  \ hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
