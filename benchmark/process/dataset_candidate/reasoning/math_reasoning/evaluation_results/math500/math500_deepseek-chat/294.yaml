answer: "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define the\
  \ integers**: Let the three consecutive positive integers be \\( n \\), \\( n+1\
  \ \\), and \\( n+2 \\). The largest of these integers is \\( n+2 \\).\n\n2. **Sum\
  \ of the integers**: The sum of these three integers is:\n   \\[\n   n + (n+1) +\
  \ (n+2) = 3n + 3.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Palindrome condition**: The sum \\( 3n + 3 \\\
  ) is a three-digit palindrome less than 220. A three-digit palindrome has the form\
  \ \\( aba \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are digits, and \\( a \\neq 0 \\).\
  \ The smallest three-digit palindrome is 101, and the largest less than 220 is 212.\n\
  \n4. **Possible palindromes**: The three-digit palindromes less than 220 are:\n\
  \   \\[\n   101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, 212.\n   \\]\n\
  \n5. **Solve for \\( n \\)**: We need \\( 3n + 3 \\) to be one of these palindromes.\
  \ Rearranging the equation:\n   \\[\n   3n + 3 = \\text{palindrome} \\implies n\
  \ = \\frac{\\text{palindrome} - 3}{3}.\n   \\]\n   For \\( n \\) to be an integer,\
  \ \\( \\text{palindrome} - 3 \\) must be divisible by 3.\n\n6. **Check divisibility**:\
  \ Among the palindromes listed, the ones where \\( \\text{palindrome} - 3 \\) is\
  \ divisible by 3 are:\n   - \\( 111 - 3 = 108 \\), which is divisible by 3.\n  \
  \ - \\( 141 - 3 = 138 \\), which is divisible by 3.\n   - \\( 171 - 3 = 168 \\),\
  \ which is divisible by 3.\n   - \\( 212 - 3 = 209 \\), which is not divisible by\
  \ 3.\n\n7. **Find the largest \\( n \\)**: The largest palindrome in the list that\
  \ satisfies the condition is 171. Solving for \\( n \\):\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{171\
  \ - 3}{3} = \\frac{168}{3} = 56.\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the largest integer in the\
  \ set is \\( n + 2 = 56 + 2 = 58 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(58\\\
  ). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
