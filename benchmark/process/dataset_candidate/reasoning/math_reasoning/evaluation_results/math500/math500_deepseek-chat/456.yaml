answer: "To find all the integer roots of the polynomial equation:\n\\[\nx^4 + 5x^3\
  \ + 9x^2 - x - 14 = 0,\n\\]\nwe can use the **Rational Root Theorem**. This theorem\
  \ states that any possible rational root of the polynomial, expressed in lowest\
  \ terms as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), must satisfy:\n- \\(p\\) is a divisor of the constant\
  \ term (\\(-14\\)),\n- \\(q\\) is a divisor of the leading coefficient (\\(1\\)).\n\
  \nSince the leading coefficient is \\(1\\), the possible integer roots are the divisors\
  \ of \\(-14\\):\n\\[\n\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14.\n\\]\n\nWe will test these\
  \ possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial:\n\n1. **Test \\(x = 1\\\
  ):**\n   \\[\n   1^4 + 5(1)^3 + 9(1)^2 - 1 - 14 = 1 + 5 + 9 - 1 - 14 = 0.\n   \\\
  ]\n   \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\n2. **Test \\(x = -1\\):**\n   \\[\n   (-1)^4 + 5(-1)^3\
  \ + 9(-1)^2 - (-1) - 14 = 1 - 5 + 9 + 1 - 14 = -8.\n   \\]\n   \\(x = -1\\) is not\
  \ a root.\n\n3. **Test \\(x = 2\\):**\n   \\[\n   2^4 + 5(2)^3 + 9(2)^2 - 2 - 14\
  \ = 16 + 40 + 36 - 2 - 14 = 76.\n   \\]\n   \\(x = 2\\) is not a root.\n\n4. **Test\
  \ \\(x = -2\\):**\n   \\[\n   (-2)^4 + 5(-2)^3 + 9(-2)^2 - (-2) - 14 = 16 - 40 +\
  \ 36 + 2 - 14 = 0.\n   \\]\n   \\(x = -2\\) is a root.\n\n5. **Test \\(x = 7\\):**\n\
  \   \\[\n   7^4 + 5(7)^3 + 9(7)^2 - 7 - 14 = 2401 + 1715 + 441 - 7 - 14 = 4536.\n\
  \   \\]\n   \\(x = 7\\) is not a root.\n\n6. **Test \\(x = -7\\):**\n   \\[\n  \
  \ (-7)^4 + 5(-7)^3 + 9(-7)^2 - (-7) - 14 = 2401 - 1715 + 441 + 7 - 14 = 1120.\n\
  \   \\]\n   \\(x = -7\\) is not a root.\n\n7. **Test \\(x = 14\\):**\n   \\[\n \
  \  14^4 + 5(14)^3 + 9(14)^2 - 14 - 14 = 38416 + 13720 + 1764 - 14 - 14 = 53872.\n\
  \   \\]\n   \\(x = 14\\) is not a root.\n\n8. **Test \\(x = -14\\):**\n   \\[\n\
  \   (-14)^4 + 5(-14)^3 + 9(-14)^2 - (-14) - 14 = 38416 - 13720 + 1764 + 14 - 14\
  \ = 26460.\n   \\]\n   \\(x = -14\\) is not a root.\n\nFrom the above tests, the\
  \ only integer roots are \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -2\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is \\(1, -2\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
