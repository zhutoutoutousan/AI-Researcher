answer: "To find the area of the equiangular octagon, we can break it down into simpler\
  \ shapes. An equiangular octagon can be divided into a rectangle and four right\
  \ triangles.\n\n1. **Understanding the Octagon:**\n   - The octagon has four sides\
  \ of length \\(1\\) and four sides of length \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n   - The\
  \ sides alternate in length, so no two consecutive sides are the same.\n\n2. **Breaking\
  \ Down the Octagon:**\n   - Imagine the octagon as a rectangle with four right triangles\
  \ attached to its sides.\n   - The rectangle will have sides equal to the sum of\
  \ the lengths of the alternating sides.\n\n3. **Calculating the Dimensions of the\
  \ Rectangle:**\n   - The longer sides of the rectangle will be \\(1 + \\frac{\\\
  sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n   - The shorter sides of the rectangle will be \\(1 + \\frac{\\\
  sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n\n4. **Calculating the Area of the Rectangle:**\n   - The area\
  \ of the rectangle is \\((1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) \\times (1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})\
  \ = (1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2\\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Area of the Triangles:**\n\
  \   - Each right triangle has legs of length \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\).\n   - The\
  \ area of one triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\times \\\
  frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\n   - Since there are four such triangles,\
  \ their total area is \\(4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1\\).\n\n6. **Total Area of the\
  \ Octagon:**\n   - The total area is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the\
  \ area of the triangles.\n   - The area of the rectangle is \\((1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})^2\
  \ = 1 + \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\).\n   - Adding the\
  \ area of the triangles, the total area is \\(\\frac{3}{2} + \\sqrt{2} + 1 = \\\
  frac{5}{2} + \\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{5}{2}\
  \ + \\sqrt{2}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
