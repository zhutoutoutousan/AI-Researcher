answer: 'To solve this problem, we can use the **binomial probability formula**. The
  binomial probability formula calculates the probability of obtaining exactly \(
  k \) successes in \( n \) independent trials, where each trial has a success probability
  of \( p \). The formula is:


  \[

  P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}

  \]


  Here:

  - \( n = 7 \) (the number of islands),

  - \( k = 4 \) (the number of islands with treasure),

  - \( p = \frac{1}{5} \) (the probability of an island having treasure).


  Substitute these values into the formula:


  \[

  P(4) = \binom{7}{4} \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right)^{7-4}

  \]


  First, calculate the binomial coefficient \( \binom{7}{4} \):


  \[

  \binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4! \cdot (7-4)!} = \frac{7!}{4! \cdot 3!} = \frac{5040}{24
  \cdot 6} = 35

  \]


  Next, calculate \( \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 \):


  \[

  \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{625}

  \]


  Then, calculate \( \left(1 - \frac{1}{5}\right)^{3} \):


  \[

  \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{125}

  \]


  Now, multiply all the terms together:


  \[

  P(4) = 35 \cdot \frac{1}{625} \cdot \frac{64}{125} = 35 \cdot \frac{64}{78125} =
  \frac{2240}{78125}

  \]


  Simplify the fraction:


  \[

  \frac{2240}{78125} = \frac{448}{15625} = \frac{448}{15625}

  \]


  Thus, the probability that exactly 4 of the islands have treasure is:


  \[

  \boxed{\frac{448}{15625}}

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\frac{448}{15625}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
