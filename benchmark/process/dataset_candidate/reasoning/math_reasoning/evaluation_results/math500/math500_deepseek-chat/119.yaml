answer: 'To find the minimum possible value of the expression \(1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5
  + 6\) by adding parentheses, we need to strategically place the parentheses to minimize
  the result. Let''s analyze the expression step by step.


  The original expression is:

  \[1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\]


  We can group terms using parentheses to change the order of operations. The goal
  is to minimize the value, so we want to subtract as much as possible. Here''s one
  way to do it:


  1. Group the terms as follows:

  \[1 + 2 + (3 - 4) + 5 + 6\]


  2. Now, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

  \[3 - 4 = -1\]


  3. Substitute this back into the expression:

  \[1 + 2 - 1 + 5 + 6\]


  4. Now, perform the additions and subtractions from left to right:

  \[1 + 2 = 3\]

  \[3 - 1 = 2\]

  \[2 + 5 = 7\]

  \[7 + 6 = 13\]


  This gives us the original value of 13, which is not the minimum. Let''s try another
  grouping:


  1. Group the terms as follows:

  \[1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5) + 6\]


  2. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

  \[4 + 5 = 9\]


  3. Substitute this back into the expression:

  \[1 + 2 + 3 - 9 + 6\]


  4. Now, perform the additions and subtractions from left to right:

  \[1 + 2 = 3\]

  \[3 + 3 = 6\]

  \[6 - 9 = -3\]

  \[-3 + 6 = 3\]


  This gives us a value of 3, which is better than 13 but still not the minimum. Let''s
  try another grouping:


  1. Group the terms as follows:

  \[1 + 2 + (3 - 4 + 5) + 6\]


  2. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

  \[3 - 4 + 5 = -1 + 5 = 4\]


  3. Substitute this back into the expression:

  \[1 + 2 + 4 + 6\]


  4. Now, perform the additions:

  \[1 + 2 = 3\]

  \[3 + 4 = 7\]

  \[7 + 6 = 13\]


  This gives us the original value of 13 again. Let''s try one more grouping:


  1. Group the terms as follows:

  \[1 + (2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6\]


  2. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

  \[2 + 3 - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1\]


  3. Substitute this back into the expression:

  \[1 + 1 + 5 + 6\]


  4. Now, perform the additions:

  \[1 + 1 = 2\]

  \[2 + 5 = 7\]

  \[7 + 6 = 13\]


  This also gives us the original value of 13. Let''s try one final grouping:


  1. Group the terms as follows:

  \[(1 + 2 + 3 - 4) + 5 + 6\]


  2. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

  \[1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\]


  3. Substitute this back into the expression:

  \[2 + 5 + 6\]


  4. Now, perform the additions:

  \[2 + 5 = 7\]

  \[7 + 6 = 13\]


  This also gives us the original value of 13. After trying several groupings, the
  minimum value we have achieved so far is 3. However, let''s try one more grouping
  to see if we can achieve a lower value:


  1. Group the terms as follows:

  \[1 + 2 + 3 - (4 + 5 + 6)\]


  2. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

  \[4 + 5 + 6 = 15\]


  3. Substitute this back into the expression:

  \[1 + 2 + 3 - 15\]


  4. Now, perform the additions and subtractions:

  \[1 + 2 = 3\]

  \[3 + 3 = 6\]

  \[6 - 15 = -9\]


  This gives us a value of \(-9\), which is lower than any of the previous values
  we have obtained. Therefore, the minimum possible value of the expression \(1 +
  2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6\) by adding parentheses is \(-9\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(-9\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
