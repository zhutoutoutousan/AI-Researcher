answer: "To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the side length\
  \ of the equilateral triangle:**\n   \n   The area \\( A \\) of an equilateral triangle\
  \ with side length \\( s \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\
  \   \\]\n   \n   We are given that the area is \\( 16\\sqrt{3} \\), so:\n   \\[\n\
  \   \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 16\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n   \n   Divide both sides by\
  \ \\( \\sqrt{3} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{4} s^2 = 16\n   \\]\n   \n   Multiply\
  \ both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n   Take the square root of\
  \ both sides:\n   \\[\n   s = 8\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the side length of the equilateral\
  \ triangle is \\( 8 \\) cm.\n\n2. **Find the perimeter of the equilateral triangle:**\n\
  \   \n   The perimeter \\( P \\) of an equilateral triangle is:\n   \\[\n   P =\
  \ 3s = 3 \\times 8 = 24 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the square has the same\
  \ perimeter as the triangle, the perimeter of the square is also \\( 24 \\) cm.\n\
  \n3. **Find the side length of the square:**\n   \n   The perimeter \\( P \\) of\
  \ a square with side length \\( a \\) is:\n   \\[\n   P = 4a\n   \\]\n   \n   We\
  \ know the perimeter is \\( 24 \\) cm, so:\n   \\[\n   4a = 24\n   \\]\n   \n  \
  \ Divide both sides by 4:\n   \\[\n   a = 6\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the side length\
  \ of the square is \\( 6 \\) cm.\n\n4. **Find the diagonal of the square:**\n  \
  \ \n   The diagonal \\( d \\) of a square with side length \\( a \\) is given by:\n\
  \   \\[\n   d = a\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   Substituting \\( a = 6 \\):\n   \\[\n\
  \   d = 6\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the diagonal of the square is \\( 6\\sqrt{2}\
  \ \\) cm.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(6\\sqrt{2}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
