answer: "To solve the problem, we need to find the least positive integer multiple\
  \ of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2. Let's break this down\
  \ step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the problem**:\n   - A multiple of 30 must\
  \ be divisible by both 2, 3, and 5.\n   - Since the number must be written using\
  \ only the digits 0 and 2, it must end with a 0 (to satisfy divisibility by 2 and\
  \ 5).\n   - The sum of the digits must be divisible by 3 (to satisfy divisibility\
  \ by 3).\n\n2. **Constructing the number**:\n   - The smallest number using only\
  \ 0 and 2 that ends with 0 is 20. However, 20 is not divisible by 3 (2 + 0 = 2,\
  \ which is not divisible by 3).\n   - The next smallest number is 220. The sum of\
  \ its digits is 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, which is not divisible by 3.\n   - The next number\
  \ is 2020. The sum of its digits is 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4, which is not divisible by\
  \ 3.\n   - The next number is 2220. The sum of its digits is 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 6,\
  \ which is divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Verifying divisibility**:\n   - 2220 is divisible\
  \ by 2 (ends with 0).\n   - 2220 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 6, which is\
  \ divisible by 3).\n   - 2220 is divisible by 5 (ends with 0).\n   - Therefore,\
  \ 2220 is divisible by 30.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The least positive integer\
  \ multiple of 30 that can be written using only the digits 0 and 2 is 2220.\n\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is 2220. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
