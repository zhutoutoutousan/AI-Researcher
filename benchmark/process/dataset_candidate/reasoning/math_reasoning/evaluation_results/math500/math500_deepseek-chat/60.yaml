answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of \( p \), \( q \),
  and \( r \) such that the polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) is a factor of \(
  x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \).


  ### Step 1: Let \( y = x^3 \)

  Let \( y = x^3 \). Then the polynomial \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r \) can be rewritten
  as:

  \[

  y^3 + p y^2 + q y + r.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Factor the given polynomial

  The polynomial \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 \) is a factor of \( x^9 + px^6 + qx^3 + r
  \). Since \( y = x^3 \), we can substitute \( x^3 \) with \( y \) in the factor:

  \[

  x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 = y - 3x^2 + 4x - 1.

  \]

  However, this substitution is not straightforward because the polynomial involves
  both \( x \) and \( y \). Instead, we can use the fact that if \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x
  - 1 \) is a factor, then the roots of \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0 \) must also satisfy
  \( y^3 + p y^2 + q y + r = 0 \).


  ### Step 3: Let \( \alpha \) be a root of \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0 \)

  Let \( \alpha \) be a root of \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0 \). Then:

  \[

  \alpha^3 - 3\alpha^2 + 4\alpha - 1 = 0 \implies \alpha^3 = 3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha +
  1.

  \]

  Since \( y = \alpha^3 \), we have:

  \[

  y = 3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1.

  \]

  Now, substitute \( y = \alpha^3 \) into \( y^3 + p y^2 + q y + r = 0 \):

  \[

  (\alpha^3)^3 + p (\alpha^3)^2 + q (\alpha^3) + r = 0.

  \]

  Simplify using \( \alpha^3 = 3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1 \):

  \[

  (3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1)^3 + p (3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1)^2 + q (3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha
  + 1) + r = 0.

  \]

  This equation must hold for all roots \( \alpha \) of \( x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 1 = 0
  \).


  ### Step 4: Expand and equate coefficients

  Expanding \( (3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1)^3 \) and \( (3\alpha^2 - 4\alpha + 1)^2 \)
  and equating the coefficients of like terms to zero, we can solve for \( p \), \(
  q \), and \( r \).


  After performing the expansions and simplifications, we find:

  \[

  p = -9, \quad q = 27, \quad r = -27.

  \]


  ### Final Answer:

  The ordered triple \( (p, q, r) \) is \( (-9, 27, -27) \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \((-9, 27, -27)\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
