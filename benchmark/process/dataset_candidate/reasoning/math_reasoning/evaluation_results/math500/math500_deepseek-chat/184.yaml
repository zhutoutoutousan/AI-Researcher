answer: 'To find the set of all possible values of the expression:


  \[

  \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c},

  \]


  where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive real numbers, we can proceed as follows:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Simplify the expression

  Let \(x = \frac{c}{a}\), \(y = \frac{b}{c}\), and \(z = \frac{a}{b + c}\). Then
  the expression becomes:


  \[

  x + z + y.

  \]


  From the definitions of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), we have:


  \[

  z = \frac{a}{b + c} = \frac{a}{c \cdot \frac{b}{c} + c} = \frac{a}{c(y + 1)} = \frac{1}{x(y
  + 1)}.

  \]


  Thus, the expression simplifies to:


  \[

  x + y + \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Use the AM-GM inequality

  We can apply the **Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality** to find the
  minimum value of the expression. The AM-GM inequality states that for positive real
  numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean.


  Consider the terms \(x\), \(y\), and \(\frac{1}{x(y + 1)}\). By AM-GM:


  \[

  x + y + \frac{1}{x(y + 1)} \geq 3 \sqrt[3]{x \cdot y \cdot \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}}.

  \]


  Simplify the right-hand side:


  \[

  3 \sqrt[3]{x \cdot y \cdot \frac{1}{x(y + 1)}} = 3 \sqrt[3]{\frac{y}{y + 1}}.

  \]


  Since \(y > 0\), \(\frac{y}{y + 1} < 1\), and the minimum value of the expression
  is greater than or equal to \(3 \cdot 1 = 3\).


  ---


  ### Step 3: Verify the minimum value

  The minimum value of \(3\) is achieved when \(x = y = 1\) and \(z = \frac{1}{2}\).
  Substituting these values into the original expression:


  \[

  1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5,

  \]


  which is less than \(3\). This suggests that the minimum value is not \(3\), and
  we need to refine our approach.


  ---


  ### Step 4: Use substitution and optimization

  Let \(x = y = 1\). Then:


  \[

  z = \frac{1}{x(y + 1)} = \frac{1}{1 \cdot (1 + 1)} = \frac{1}{2}.

  \]


  The expression becomes:


  \[

  1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 2.5.

  \]


  This shows that the minimum value is less than \(3\). To find the exact minimum,
  we can use calculus or observe that the expression approaches \(2\) as \(x\) and
  \(y\) approach \(0\).


  ---


  ### Step 5: Conclusion

  The expression \(\frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{b + c} + \frac{b}{c}\) can take any value
  greater than or equal to \(2\). Thus, the set of all possible values is:


  \[

  [2, \infty).

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
