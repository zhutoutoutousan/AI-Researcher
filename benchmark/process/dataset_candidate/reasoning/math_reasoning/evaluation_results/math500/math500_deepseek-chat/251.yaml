answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways six distinguishable\
  \ cars can be assigned to three lanes (left-turn, straight-going, and right-turn)\
  \ such that all three lanes are occupied. \n\n### Step 1: Total number of assignments\
  \ without restrictions\nEach of the six cars has three choices (left, straight,\
  \ or right). Therefore, the total number of possible assignments is:\n\\[\n3^6 =\
  \ 729.\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Subtract the cases where at least one lane is unoccupied\n\
  We need to subtract the cases where one or more lanes are not used. This can be\
  \ done using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n- **Case 1: One lane is unoccupied**\n\
  \  There are \\(\\binom{3}{1} = 3\\) ways to choose which lane is unoccupied. For\
  \ each such choice, the six cars are assigned to the remaining two lanes. The number\
  \ of assignments for each choice is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total number\
  \ of assignments where exactly one lane is unoccupied is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 64\
  \ = 192.\n  \\]\n\n- **Case 2: Two lanes are unoccupied**\n  There are \\(\\binom{3}{2}\
  \ = 3\\) ways to choose which two lanes are unoccupied. For each such choice, all\
  \ six cars are assigned to the remaining one lane. The number of assignments for\
  \ each choice is \\(1^6 = 1\\). Therefore, the total number of assignments where\
  \ exactly two lanes are unoccupied is:\n  \\[\n  3 \\times 1 = 3.\n  \\]\n\nUsing\
  \ the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of assignments where at least\
  \ one lane is unoccupied is:\n\\[\n192 - 3 = 189.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate\
  \ the number of valid assignments\nSubtract the number of invalid assignments (where\
  \ at least one lane is unoccupied) from the total number of assignments:\n\\[\n\
  729 - 189 = 540.\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways the cars can stack up so that\
  \ all three lanes are occupied is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{540}.\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: The\
  \ final answer is $540$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\

  \nNote that if the first car turns left and the second goes straight, this is considered\
