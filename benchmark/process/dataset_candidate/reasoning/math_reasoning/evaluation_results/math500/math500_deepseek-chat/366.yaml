answer: 'To find the modulo \(7\) remainder of the sum \(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \dots
  + 195 + 197 + 199\), we proceed step by step:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Identify the sequence and its properties

  The sequence \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \dots, 195, 197, 199\) is an arithmetic sequence of
  odd numbers. The first term \(a_1 = 1\), and the common difference \(d = 2\).


  ---


  ### Step 2: Find the number of terms in the sequence

  The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

  \[

  a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d.

  \]

  Here, \(a_n = 199\), so:

  \[

  199 = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2.

  \]

  Solving for \(n\):

  \[

  199 = 1 + 2n - 2, \\

  199 = 2n - 1, \\

  2n = 200, \\

  n = 100.

  \]

  There are \(100\) terms in the sequence.


  ---


  ### Step 3: Compute the sum of the sequence

  The sum \(S\) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

  \[

  S = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n).

  \]

  Substituting the known values:

  \[

  S = \frac{100}{2} \cdot (1 + 199), \\

  S = 50 \cdot 200, \\

  S = 10000.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Find the remainder of the sum modulo \(7\)

  We now compute \(10000 \mod 7\). First, observe that:

  \[

  10000 = 7 \cdot 1428 + 4,

  \]

  since \(7 \cdot 1428 = 9996\) and \(10000 - 9996 = 4\). Thus:

  \[

  10000 \mod 7 = 4.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
