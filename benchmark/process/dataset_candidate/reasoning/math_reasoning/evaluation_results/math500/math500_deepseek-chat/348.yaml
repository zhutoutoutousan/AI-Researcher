answer: 'To compute \(\dbinom{31}{28}\), we can use the property of combinations that
  \(\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}\). This means:


  \[

  \dbinom{31}{28} = \dbinom{31}{3}

  \]


  Now, we compute \(\dbinom{31}{3}\) using the formula for combinations:


  \[

  \dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31!}{3! \cdot (31-3)!} = \frac{31!}{3! \cdot 28!}

  \]


  Simplifying the factorials, we get:


  \[

  \dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29 \times 28!}{3! \times 28!} = \frac{31
  \times 30 \times 29}{3!}

  \]


  Since \(3! = 6\), we have:


  \[

  \dbinom{31}{3} = \frac{31 \times 30 \times 29}{6}

  \]


  Now, compute the numerator:


  \[

  31 \times 30 = 930

  \]

  \[

  930 \times 29 = 26970

  \]


  Finally, divide by 6:


  \[

  \frac{26970}{6} = 4495

  \]


  Thus, \(\dbinom{31}{28} = 4495\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(4495\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
