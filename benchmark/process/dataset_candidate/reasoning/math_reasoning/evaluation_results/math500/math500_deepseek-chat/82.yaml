answer: "To find the greatest possible value of the slope of the line containing points\
  \ \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we need to maximize the slope \\( m = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B\
  \ - x_A} \\). \n\n1. **Identify the regions for points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\):**\n\
  \   - Point \\( A \\) lies within or on the square with opposite corners at \\(\
  \ (0, 0) \\) and \\( (2, 2) \\). Therefore, \\( A \\) has coordinates \\( (x_A,\
  \ y_A) \\) where \\( 0 \\leq x_A \\leq 2 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq y_A \\leq 2 \\).\n\
  \   - Point \\( B \\) lies within or on the square with opposite corners at \\(\
  \ (4, 2) \\) and \\( (5, 3) \\). Therefore, \\( B \\) has coordinates \\( (x_B,\
  \ y_B) \\) where \\( 4 \\leq x_B \\leq 5 \\) and \\( 2 \\leq y_B \\leq 3 \\).\n\n\
  2. **Maximize the slope \\( m = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} \\):**\n   - To maximize\
  \ \\( m \\), we want to maximize \\( y_B - y_A \\) and minimize \\( x_B - x_A \\\
  ).\n   - The maximum value of \\( y_B - y_A \\) occurs when \\( y_B \\) is as large\
  \ as possible and \\( y_A \\) is as small as possible. Thus, \\( y_B = 3 \\) and\
  \ \\( y_A = 0 \\).\n   - The minimum value of \\( x_B - x_A \\) occurs when \\(\
  \ x_B \\) is as small as possible and \\( x_A \\) is as large as possible. Thus,\
  \ \\( x_B = 4 \\) and \\( x_A = 2 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the slope:**\n   \\[\n\
  \   m = \\frac{y_B - y_A}{x_B - x_A} = \\frac{3 - 0}{4 - 2} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n  \
  \ \\]\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible value of the slope of the line containing\
  \ points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
