answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the number of terms \( n \) in the
  geometric sequence \(\left\{\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \dots \right\}\)
  such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms is \(\frac{255}{512}\).


  ### Step 1: Identify the first term and common ratio

  The first term \( a \) of the geometric sequence is:

  \[

  a = \frac{1}{4}.

  \]

  The common ratio \( r \) is the ratio of the second term to the first term:

  \[

  r = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric
  sequence

  The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric sequence is given by:

  \[

  S_n = a \cdot \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}.

  \]

  Substitute \( a = \frac{1}{4} \), \( r = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( S_n = \frac{255}{512}
  \):

  \[

  \frac{255}{512} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{1 - \frac{1}{2}}.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Simplify the equation

  First, simplify the denominator \( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \). Then:

  \[

  \frac{255}{512} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{\frac{1}{2}}.

  \]

  Multiply the numerator and denominator:

  \[

  \frac{255}{512} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right).

  \]

  Simplify further:

  \[

  \frac{255}{512} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right).

  \]

  Multiply both sides by 2:

  \[

  \frac{255}{256} = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Solve for \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \)

  Rearrange the equation:

  \[

  \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = 1 - \frac{255}{256}.

  \]

  Simplify the right-hand side:

  \[

  \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{1}{256}.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Express \( \frac{1}{256} \) as a power of \( \frac{1}{2} \)

  We know that:

  \[

  \frac{1}{256} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8.

  \]

  Thus:

  \[

  \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8.

  \]


  ### Step 6: Equate the exponents

  Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:

  \[

  n = 8.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(8\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
