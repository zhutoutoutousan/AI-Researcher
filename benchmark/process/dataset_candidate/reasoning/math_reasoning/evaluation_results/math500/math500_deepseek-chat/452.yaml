answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Let the two-digit number be\
  \ \\(10a + b\\), where \\(a\\) is the tens digit and \\(b\\) is the units digit.**\n\
  \   - The sum of the digits is \\(a + b = 13\\).\n\n2. **The number with its digits\
  \ reversed is \\(10b + a\\).**\n   - The difference between the original number\
  \ and the reversed number is \\(27\\):\n     \\[\n     (10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27.\n\
  \     \\]\n     Simplifying this:\n     \\[\n     9a - 9b = 27 \\implies a - b =\
  \ 3.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Now we have a system of equations:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n\
  \   a + b = 13, \\\\\n   a - b = 3.\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   Adding these two\
  \ equations:\n   \\[\n   2a = 16 \\implies a = 8.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(a\
  \ = 8\\) into \\(a + b = 13\\):\n   \\[\n   8 + b = 13 \\implies b = 5.\n   \\]\n\
  \n4. **The original number is \\(10a + b = 10(8) + 5 = 85\\).**\n   - The reversed\
  \ number is \\(10b + a = 10(5) + 8 = 58\\).\n\n5. **The sum of the original number\
  \ and the reversed number is:**\n   \\[\n   85 + 58 = 143.\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\(143\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
