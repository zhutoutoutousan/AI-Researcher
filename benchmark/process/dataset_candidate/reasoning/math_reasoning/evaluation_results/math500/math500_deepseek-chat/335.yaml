answer: 'To find the remainder when the \(100^{\text{th}}\) term of the Fibonacci
  sequence is divided by 4, we can use the concept of **modular arithmetic** and the
  **periodicity** of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4.


  ### Step 1: Understand the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4

  The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:

  \[

  F_1 = 1, \quad F_2 = 1, \quad F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \quad \text{for} \quad n \geq
  3.

  \]

  We are interested in the sequence modulo 4, i.e., \(F_n \mod 4\).


  ### Step 2: Compute the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4

  Let''s compute the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:

  \[

  \begin{align*}

  F_1 &\equiv 1 \mod 4, \\

  F_2 &\equiv 1 \mod 4, \\

  F_3 &\equiv F_1 + F_2 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \mod 4, \\

  F_4 &\equiv F_2 + F_3 \equiv 1 + 2 \equiv 3 \mod 4, \\

  F_5 &\equiv F_3 + F_4 \equiv 2 + 3 \equiv 1 \mod 4, \\

  F_6 &\equiv F_4 + F_5 \equiv 3 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 4, \\

  F_7 &\equiv F_5 + F_6 \equiv 1 + 0 \equiv 1 \mod 4, \\

  F_8 &\equiv F_6 + F_7 \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4, \\

  F_9 &\equiv F_7 + F_8 \equiv 1 + 1 \equiv 2 \mod 4, \\

  F_{10} &\equiv F_8 + F_9 \equiv 1 + 2 \equiv 3 \mod 4, \\

  F_{11} &\equiv F_9 + F_{10} \equiv 2 + 3 \equiv 1 \mod 4, \\

  F_{12} &\equiv F_{10} + F_{11} \equiv 3 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 4.

  \end{align*}

  \]

  Observing the pattern, we notice that the sequence repeats every **6 terms**:

  \[

  1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, \ldots

  \]


  ### Step 3: Find the position of the \(100^{\text{th}}\) term in the cycle

  Since the sequence repeats every 6 terms, we can find the remainder when 100 is
  divided by 6:

  \[

  100 \div 6 = 16 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 4.

  \]

  This means the \(100^{\text{th}}\) term corresponds to the \(4^{\text{th}}\) term
  in the cycle.


  ### Step 4: Determine the value of the \(4^{\text{th}}\) term in the cycle

  From the cycle \(1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0\), the \(4^{\text{th}}\) term is **3**.


  ### Step 5: Conclusion

  The remainder when the \(100^{\text{th}}\) term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided
  by 4 is **3**.

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
