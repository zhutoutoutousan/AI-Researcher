answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the equation of the set of image points
  when each point on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \) is reflected over the point \(
  (4, 1) \).


  ### Step 1: Understand the reflection

  Reflecting a point \( (x, y) \) over another point \( (4, 1) \) results in a new
  point \( (x'', y'') \). The reflection formula is:

  \[

  (x'', y'') = (2 \cdot 4 - x, 2 \cdot 1 - y) = (8 - x, 2 - y).

  \]


  ### Step 2: Substitute into the original equation

  The original circle equation is \( x^2 + y^2 = 25 \). After reflection, the new
  coordinates \( (x'', y'') \) satisfy:

  \[

  x'' = 8 - x \quad \text{and} \quad y'' = 2 - y.

  \]

  Substitute \( x = 8 - x'' \) and \( y = 2 - y'' \) into the original equation:

  \[

  (8 - x'')^2 + (2 - y'')^2 = 25.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Expand and simplify

  Expand the equation:

  \[

  (8 - x'')^2 + (2 - y'')^2 = 25 \\

  64 - 16x'' + x''^2 + 4 - 4y'' + y''^2 = 25.

  \]

  Combine like terms:

  \[

  x''^2 + y''^2 - 16x'' - 4y'' + 68 = 25.

  \]

  Subtract 25 from both sides:

  \[

  x''^2 + y''^2 - 16x'' - 4y'' + 43 = 0.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Identify the coefficients

  The equation \( x''^2 + y''^2 - 16x'' - 4y'' + 43 = 0 \) corresponds to the general
  form:

  \[

  x^2 + ay^2 + bx + cy + d = 0.

  \]

  Comparing coefficients:

  - \( a = 1 \) (coefficient of \( y^2 \)),

  - \( b = -16 \) (coefficient of \( x \)),

  - \( c = -4 \) (coefficient of \( y \)),

  - \( d = 43 \) (constant term).


  ### Final Answer

  The ordered quadruple \( (a, b, c, d) \) is \( (1, -16, -4, 43) \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is $(1, -16, -4, 43)$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
