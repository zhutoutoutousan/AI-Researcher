answer: 'To find the largest \( x \)-value at which the graphs of \( f(x) \) and \(
  g(x) \) intersect, we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = g(x) \). Let''s analyze
  the given functions:


  \[

  f(x) = e^{3x^2 - |\lfloor x \rfloor|!} + \binom{22 + 735235|\lfloor x \rfloor|}{2356}
  + \phi(|\lfloor x \rfloor| + 1) + 72x^4 + 3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1

  \]


  \[

  g(x) = e^{3x^2 - |\lfloor x \rfloor|!} + \binom{22 + 735235|\lfloor x \rfloor|}{2356}
  + \phi(|\lfloor x \rfloor| + 1) + 72x^4 + 4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13

  \]


  ### Step 1: Simplify the equation \( f(x) = g(x) \)

  Subtract \( f(x) \) from \( g(x) \):


  \[

  g(x) - f(x) = (4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13) - (3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x + 1) = 0

  \]


  Simplify the equation:


  \[

  4x^3 - 11x^2 - 6x + 13 - 3x^3 + 6x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0

  \]


  \[

  x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0

  \]


  ### Step 2: Solve the cubic equation \( x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 \)

  We look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots
  are \( \pm1, \pm2, \pm3, \pm4, \pm6, \pm12 \).


  Test \( x = 3 \):


  \[

  3^3 - 5(3)^2 - 8(3) + 12 = 27 - 45 - 24 + 12 = -30 \neq 0

  \]


  Test \( x = 4 \):


  \[

  4^3 - 5(4)^2 - 8(4) + 12 = 64 - 80 - 32 + 12 = -36 \neq 0

  \]


  Test \( x = 2 \):


  \[

  2^3 - 5(2)^2 - 8(2) + 12 = 8 - 20 - 16 + 12 = -16 \neq 0

  \]


  Test \( x = 1 \):


  \[

  1^3 - 5(1)^2 - 8(1) + 12 = 1 - 5 - 8 + 12 = 0

  \]


  So, \( x = 1 \) is a root. Factor the cubic polynomial:


  \[

  x^3 - 5x^2 - 8x + 12 = (x - 1)(x^2 - 4x - 12)

  \]


  Now solve \( x^2 - 4x - 12 = 0 \):


  \[

  x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 48}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{2}

  \]


  \[

  x = 6 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2

  \]


  ### Step 3: Determine the largest \( x \)-value

  The roots are \( x = 1 \), \( x = 6 \), and \( x = -2 \). The largest \( x \)-value
  is \( x = 6 \).


  ### Step 4: Verify the solution

  Ensure that \( x = 6 \) satisfies the original equation \( f(x) = g(x) \). Since
  the simplification led to a valid solution, \( x = 6 \) is indeed the largest \(
  x \)-value where the graphs intersect.


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(6\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
