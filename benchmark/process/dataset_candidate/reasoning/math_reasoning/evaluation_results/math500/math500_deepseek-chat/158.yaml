answer: "To find the sum of all multiples of 7 between 100 and 200, we first identify\
  \ the smallest and largest multiples of 7 in this range.\n\n1. **Find the smallest\
  \ multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 100:**\n   - Divide 100 by 7: \\(100 \\\
  div 7 \\approx 14.2857\\).\n   - The next whole number is 15, so the smallest multiple\
  \ is \\(7 \\times 15 = 105\\).\n\n2. **Find the largest multiple of 7 less than\
  \ or equal to 200:**\n   - Divide 200 by 7: \\(200 \\div 7 \\approx 28.5714\\).\n\
  \   - The largest whole number less than or equal to 28.5714 is 28, so the largest\
  \ multiple is \\(7 \\times 28 = 196\\).\n\n3. **List the multiples of 7 between\
  \ 100 and 200:**\n   - The multiples are \\(105, 112, 119, \\dots, 196\\).\n\n4.\
  \ **Determine the number of terms in this sequence:**\n   - The sequence starts\
  \ at 105 and ends at 196, with a common difference of 7.\n   - The number of terms\
  \ \\(n\\) can be found using the formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an arithmetic\
  \ sequence:\n     \\[\n     a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n     \\]\n     where \\(a_n = 196\\\
  ), \\(a_1 = 105\\), and \\(d = 7\\).\n     \\[\n     196 = 105 + (n-1) \\times 7\n\
  \     \\]\n     \\[\n     196 - 105 = (n-1) \\times 7\n     \\]\n     \\[\n    \
  \ 91 = (n-1) \\times 7\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n-1 = 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n\
  \     n = 14\n     \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**\n   - The sum\
  \ \\(S\\) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{n}{2}\
  \ \\times (a_1 + a_n)\n     \\]\n     where \\(n = 14\\), \\(a_1 = 105\\), and \\\
  (a_n = 196\\).\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{14}{2} \\times (105 + 196)\n     \\]\n\
  \     \\[\n     S = 7 \\times 301\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S = 2107\n     \\]\n\
  \nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(2107\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
