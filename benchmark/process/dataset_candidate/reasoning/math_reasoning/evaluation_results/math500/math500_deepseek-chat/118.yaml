answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\)
  of integers such that \(|a + bi| \le 5\). The modulus of a complex number \(a +
  bi\) is given by:


  \[

  |a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.

  \]


  Thus, the inequality \(|a + bi| \le 5\) becomes:


  \[

  \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \le 5 \implies a^2 + b^2 \le 25.

  \]


  We need to count all integer pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(a^2 + b^2 \le 25\).
  This is equivalent to finding all lattice points (points with integer coordinates)
  inside or on the circle of radius 5 centered at the origin.


  ### Step 1: Determine the range of \(a\) and \(b\)

  Since \(a^2 \le 25\) and \(b^2 \le 25\), the possible integer values for \(a\) and
  \(b\) are:


  \[

  a \in \{-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\},

  \]

  \[

  b \in \{-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Count the number of valid \((a, b)\) pairs

  We can iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and count the pairs
  that satisfy \(a^2 + b^2 \le 25\).


  - For \(a = 0\): \(b^2 \le 25\), so \(b \in \{-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
  5\}\). This gives 11 pairs.

  - For \(a = \pm1\): \(b^2 \le 24\), so \(b \in \{-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
  This gives 9 pairs for each \(a = 1\) and \(a = -1\), totaling 18 pairs.

  - For \(a = \pm2\): \(b^2 \le 21\), so \(b \in \{-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
  This gives 9 pairs for each \(a = 2\) and \(a = -2\), totaling 18 pairs.

  - For \(a = \pm3\): \(b^2 \le 16\), so \(b \in \{-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
  This gives 9 pairs for each \(a = 3\) and \(a = -3\), totaling 18 pairs.

  - For \(a = \pm4\): \(b^2 \le 9\), so \(b \in \{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This
  gives 7 pairs for each \(a = 4\) and \(a = -4\), totaling 14 pairs.

  - For \(a = \pm5\): \(b^2 \le 0\), so \(b = 0\). This gives 1 pair for each \(a
  = 5\) and \(a = -5\), totaling 2 pairs.


  ### Step 3: Sum the counts

  Adding up all the valid pairs:


  \[

  11 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 14 + 2 = 81.

  \]


  Thus, there are **81** ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(|a + bi| \le 5\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(81\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
