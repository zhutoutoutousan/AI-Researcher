answer: "To determine who earns the most after working an eight-hour day, we need\
  \ to convert each person's hourly wage into US dollars and then calculate their\
  \ total earnings for eight hours.\n\n1. **Navin's Earnings:**\n   - Navin earns\
  \ 160 rupee per hour.\n   - 1 US dollar = 32.35 Mauritius rupee.\n   - Navin's hourly\
  \ wage in US dollars: \\( \\frac{160}{32.35} \\approx 4.95 \\) USD.\n   - Total\
  \ earnings for 8 hours: \\( 4.95 \\times 8 = 39.60 \\) USD.\n\n2. **Luka's Earnings:**\n\
  \   - Luka earns 25 kuna per hour.\n   - 1 US dollar = 5.18 Croatian kuna.\n   -\
  \ Luka's hourly wage in US dollars: \\( \\frac{25}{5.18} \\approx 4.83 \\) USD.\n\
  \   - Total earnings for 8 hours: \\( 4.83 \\times 8 = 38.64 \\) USD.\n\n3. **Ian's\
  \ Earnings:**\n   - Ian earns 34 pula per hour.\n   - 1 US dollar = 6.95 Botswana\
  \ pula.\n   - Ian's hourly wage in US dollars: \\( \\frac{34}{6.95} \\approx 4.89\
  \ \\) USD.\n   - Total earnings for 8 hours: \\( 4.89 \\times 8 = 39.12 \\) USD.\n\
  \n**Comparison:**\n- Navin: 39.60 USD\n- Luka: 38.64 USD\n- Ian: 39.12 USD\n\nNavin\
  \ earns the most after working an eight-hour day.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is Navin. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
  \nProblem:\nNavin from Mauritius, Luka from Croatia, and Ian from Botswana are chatting\
  \ in the lobby of a youth hostel discussing their part-time jobs. They learn that\
  \ Navin makes 160 rupee per hour, Luka makes 25 kuna per hour, and Ian makes 34\
  \ pula per hour. If one US dollar is equivalent to 32.35 Mauritius rupee, 5.18 Croatian\
  \ kuna, and 6.95 Botswana pula, who would earn the most after working an eight-hour\
  \ day?\n\nPlease given your final answer (answer ONLY) within the format of `Final\
