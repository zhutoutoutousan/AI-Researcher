answer: "To solve for the measure of \\(\\angle PQR\\), let's analyze the given diagram\
  \ step by step.\n\n1. **Parallel Lines and Transversals**: Since \\(PT\\) is parallel\
  \ to \\(QR\\), the transversal \\(PQ\\) creates corresponding angles. This means\
  \ that \\(\\angle PQR\\) and the angle at \\(P\\) (labeled \\(x^\\circ\\)) are related.\n\
  \n2. **Angles at Point \\(Q\\)**: At point \\(Q\\), the angles around the point\
  \ must sum to \\(360^\\circ\\). We know one of the angles is \\(128^\\circ\\), and\
  \ the other two angles are \\(x^\\circ\\) and \\(2x^\\circ\\) (as labeled in the\
  \ diagram).\n\n3. **Setting Up the Equation**: The sum of the angles around point\
  \ \\(Q\\) is:\n   \\[\n   x + 2x + 128 = 360\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\\
  [\n   3x + 128 = 360\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3x = 232\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{232}{3}\n\
  \   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating \\(\\angle PQR\\)**: The measure of \\(\\angle PQR\\\
  ) is \\(2x\\), so:\n   \\[\n   \\angle PQR = 2 \\cdot \\frac{232}{3} = \\frac{464}{3}\
  \ \\approx 154.67^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nHowever, this result seems inconsistent with\
  \ typical geometric problems, suggesting a possible misinterpretation of the diagram.\
  \ Let's reconsider the angles around point \\(Q\\):\n\n- The angles around point\
  \ \\(Q\\) should sum to \\(360^\\circ\\). Given the angles \\(x\\), \\(2x\\), and\
  \ \\(128^\\circ\\), the correct equation is:\n  \\[\n  x + 2x + 128 = 360\n  \\\
  ]\n  \\[\n  3x = 232\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  x = \\frac{232}{3}\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  \\angle\
  \ PQR = 2x = \\frac{464}{3} \\approx 154.67^\\circ\n  \\]\n\nGiven the diagram and\
  \ the problem's constraints, the measure of \\(\\angle PQR\\) is \\(\\frac{464}{3}\\\
  ) degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{464}{3}\\). I hope it\
  \ is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
