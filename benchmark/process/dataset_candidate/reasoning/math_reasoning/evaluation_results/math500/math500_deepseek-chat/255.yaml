answer: "To determine the type of curve defined by the equation \\( r^2 \\cos 2\\\
  theta = 4 \\), let's analyze it step by step.\n\n1. **Recall Polar Coordinates**:\
  \ In polar coordinates, \\( r \\) represents the distance from the origin, and \\\
  ( \\theta \\) is the angle from the positive \\( x \\)-axis.\n\n2. **Use Trigonometric\
  \ Identity**: The equation \\( r^2 \\cos 2\\theta = 4 \\) can be rewritten using\
  \ the double-angle identity for cosine:\n   \\[\n   \\cos 2\\theta = \\cos^2 \\\
  theta - \\sin^2 \\theta.\n   \\]\n   Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\
  \   \\[\n   r^2 (\\cos^2 \\theta - \\sin^2 \\theta) = 4.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert\
  \ to Cartesian Coordinates**: Recall that \\( x = r \\cos \\theta \\) and \\( y\
  \ = r \\sin \\theta \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\cos^2 \\theta = \\frac{x^2}{r^2},\
  \ \\quad \\sin^2 \\theta = \\frac{y^2}{r^2}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting these into\
  \ the equation:\n   \\[\n   r^2 \\left( \\frac{x^2}{r^2} - \\frac{y^2}{r^2} \\right)\
  \ = 4.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - y^2 = 4.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identify\
  \ the Curve**: The equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = 4 \\) is the standard form of a **hyperbola**.\
  \ Specifically, it represents a hyperbola centered at the origin with its transverse\
  \ axis along the \\( x \\)-axis.\n\nThus, the curve defined by \\( r^2 \\cos 2\\\
  theta = 4 \\) is a hyperbola.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is (E). I hope it\
  \ is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
