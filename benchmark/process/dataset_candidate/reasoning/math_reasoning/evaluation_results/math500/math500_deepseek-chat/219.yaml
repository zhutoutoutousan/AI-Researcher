answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the checker\
  \ is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard after spinning the wheel twice.\n\
  \n### Step 1: Determine the possible outcomes for the first spin (column selection).\n\
  The wheel has numbers: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9. When the first number is divided by 4,\
  \ the possible remainders are:\n- 1 \xF7 4 = 0 remainder 1 \u2192 Remainder 1\n\
  - 2 \xF7 4 = 0 remainder 2 \u2192 Remainder 2\n- 3 \xF7 4 = 0 remainder 3 \u2192\
  \ Remainder 3\n- 6 \xF7 4 = 1 remainder 2 \u2192 Remainder 2\n- 7 \xF7 4 = 1 remainder\
  \ 3 \u2192 Remainder 3\n- 9 \xF7 4 = 2 remainder 1 \u2192 Remainder 1\n\nThus, the\
  \ possible remainders for the first spin are 1, 2, and 3. The probabilities for\
  \ each remainder are:\n- Remainder 1: 2/6 = 1/3\n- Remainder 2: 2/6 = 1/3\n- Remainder\
  \ 3: 2/6 = 1/3\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible outcomes for the second spin\
  \ (row selection).\nWhen the second number is divided by 5, the possible remainders\
  \ are:\n- 1 \xF7 5 = 0 remainder 1 \u2192 Remainder 1\n- 2 \xF7 5 = 0 remainder\
  \ 2 \u2192 Remainder 2\n- 3 \xF7 5 = 0 remainder 3 \u2192 Remainder 3\n- 6 \xF7\
  \ 5 = 1 remainder 1 \u2192 Remainder 1\n- 7 \xF7 5 = 1 remainder 2 \u2192 Remainder\
  \ 2\n- 9 \xF7 5 = 1 remainder 4 \u2192 Remainder 4\n\nThus, the possible remainders\
  \ for the second spin are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The probabilities for each remainder are:\n\
  - Remainder 1: 2/6 = 1/3\n- Remainder 2: 2/6 = 1/3\n- Remainder 3: 1/6\n- Remainder\
  \ 4: 1/6\n\n### Step 3: Identify the shaded squares on the checkerboard.\nFrom the\
  \ Asymptote code, the shaded squares are:\n- (Column 1, Row 1)\n- (Column 1, Row\
  \ 4)\n- (Column 2, Row 2)\n- (Column 2, Row 3)\n- (Column 3, Row 1)\n- (Column 3,\
  \ Row 4)\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the probability for each shaded square.\nWe calculate\
  \ the probability for each shaded square by multiplying the probabilities of the\
  \ corresponding column and row remainders:\n1. (Column 1, Row 1): (1/3) * (1/3)\
  \ = 1/9\n2. (Column 1, Row 4): (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18\n3. (Column 2, Row 2): (1/3)\
  \ * (1/3) = 1/9\n4. (Column 2, Row 3): (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18\n5. (Column 3, Row 1):\
  \ (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n6. (Column 3, Row 4): (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18\n\n### Step 5:\
  \ Sum the probabilities of all shaded squares.\nThe total probability is:\n\\[\n\
  \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{18} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\\
  frac{1}{18} = \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{18}\
  \ + \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{7}{18}\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\\
  frac{7}{18}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
