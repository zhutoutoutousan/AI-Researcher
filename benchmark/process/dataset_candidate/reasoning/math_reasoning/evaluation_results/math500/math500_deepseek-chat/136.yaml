answer: 'To solve this problem, we will use the concept of the **Power Mean Inequality**.
  The Power Mean Inequality states that for a sequence of positive real numbers, the
  following inequality holds:


  \[

  \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^k}{n} \right)^{1/k} \geq \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n
  a_i^m}{n} \right)^{1/m}

  \]


  for \( k > m \), with equality if and only if all the \( a_i \) are equal.


  ### Step 1: Apply the Power Mean Inequality

  We are given:

  \[

  \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 96, \quad \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = 144, \quad \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3
  = 216.

  \]


  Using the Power Mean Inequality for \( k = 2 \) and \( m = 1 \):

  \[

  \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n
  a_i}{n} \right)^{1/1}.

  \]


  Substituting the given values:

  \[

  \left( \frac{144}{n} \right)^{1/2} \geq \left( \frac{96}{n} \right).

  \]


  Squaring both sides:

  \[

  \frac{144}{n} \geq \left( \frac{96}{n} \right)^2.

  \]


  Multiplying through by \( n^2 \):

  \[

  144n \geq 96^2.

  \]


  Simplifying:

  \[

  144n \geq 9216 \implies n \geq 64.

  \]


  ### Step 2: Check for Equality

  Equality in the Power Mean Inequality holds if and only if all the \( a_i \) are
  equal. Let \( a_i = a \) for all \( i \). Then:

  \[

  \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n a = 96 \implies a = \frac{96}{n}.

  \]


  Similarly:

  \[

  \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 = n a^2 = 144 \implies a^2 = \frac{144}{n}.

  \]


  Substituting \( a = \frac{96}{n} \) into \( a^2 = \frac{144}{n} \):

  \[

  \left( \frac{96}{n} \right)^2 = \frac{144}{n} \implies \frac{9216}{n^2} = \frac{144}{n}.

  \]


  Multiplying through by \( n^2 \):

  \[

  9216 = 144n \implies n = 64.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Verify the Third Condition

  We also need to verify that the third condition holds:

  \[

  \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^3 = n a^3 = 216.

  \]


  Substituting \( a = \frac{96}{64} = \frac{3}{2} \):

  \[

  n a^3 = 64 \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^3 = 64 \cdot \frac{27}{8} = 216.

  \]


  This confirms that \( n = 64 \) is a valid solution.


  ### Step 4: Consider Other Possibilities

  The problem asks for the sum of all possible values of \( n \). From the Power Mean
  Inequality, we know that \( n \geq 64 \), and equality holds only when \( n = 64
  \). Therefore, the only possible value of \( n \) is \( 64 \).


  ### Final Answer

  The sum of all possible values of \( n \) is \( 64 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
