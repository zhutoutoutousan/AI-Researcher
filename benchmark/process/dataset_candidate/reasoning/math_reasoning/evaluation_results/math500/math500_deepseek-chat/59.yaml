answer: 'To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let''s
  break it down step by step:


  1. **Total number of students**: 50

  2. **Students who participate in neither activity**: 6

  3. **Students who participate in at least one activity**: \(50 - 6 = 44\)

  4. **Students who participate in MATHCOUNTS**: 28

  5. **Students who participate in science club**: 21


  Let \(x\) be the number of students who participate in both MATHCOUNTS and science
  club. According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion:


  \[

  \text{Students in MATHCOUNTS} + \text{Students in science club} - \text{Students
  in both} = \text{Students in at least one activity}

  \]


  Substitute the known values:


  \[

  28 + 21 - x = 44

  \]


  Solve for \(x\):


  \[

  49 - x = 44

  \]

  \[

  x = 49 - 44

  \]

  \[

  x = 5

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(5\). I hope it is correct.'
gt_answer: '5'
prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
  \nProblem:\nIn a class of 50 students, 28 participate in MATHCOUNTS, 21 participate\
  \ in science club, and 6 students participate in neither. How many students participate\
  \ in both MATHCOUNTS and science club?\n\nPlease given your final answer (answer\
  \ ONLY) within the format of `Final Answer: The final answer is <answer>. I hope\
  \ it is correct.` after your reasoning \nFor example: According to ...\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n"
