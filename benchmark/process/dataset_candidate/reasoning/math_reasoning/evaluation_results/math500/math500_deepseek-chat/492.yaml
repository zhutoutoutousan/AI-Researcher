answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the set of vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) such
  that the projection of \(\mathbf{v}\) onto the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\)
  is the zero vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\).


  The projection of \(\mathbf{v}\) onto \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) is
  given by:

  \[

  \operatorname{proj}_{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{v}
  \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
  \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.

  \]

  For this projection to be the zero vector, the dot product \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
  2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) must be zero. Let \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\).
  Then:

  \[

  \mathbf{v} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = 2x + y = 0.

  \]

  This equation represents a line in the plane. Solving for \(y\), we get:

  \[

  y = -2x.

  \]

  Thus, the set of vectors \(\mathbf{v}\) that satisfy the condition lie on the line
  \(y = -2x\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(y = -2x\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
