answer: "To determine the probability that a triangle with sides of length 1, \\(\
  \ x \\), and \\( y \\) exists, we need to use the **triangle inequality theorem**.\
  \ The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three lengths to form a triangle,\
  \ the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. \n\nFor the sides\
  \ 1, \\( x \\), and \\( y \\), the following conditions must hold:\n1. \\( 1 + x\
  \ > y \\),\n2. \\( 1 + y > x \\),\n3. \\( x + y > 1 \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\) and\
  \ \\( y \\) are selected randomly from the interval \\((0, 3)\\), we can visualize\
  \ this as a square in the \\( xy \\)-plane with side length 3. The total area of\
  \ this square is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the region within\
  \ this square where the triangle inequalities are satisfied. Let's analyze each\
  \ inequality:\n\n1. \\( 1 + x > y \\): This represents the region below the line\
  \ \\( y = 1 + x \\).\n2. \\( 1 + y > x \\): This represents the region below the\
  \ line \\( y = x - 1 \\).\n3. \\( x + y > 1 \\): This represents the region above\
  \ the line \\( y = 1 - x \\).\n\nThe intersection of these regions forms a polygon\
  \ within the square. To find the area of this polygon, we can break it into simpler\
  \ shapes:\n\n- For \\( x \\in (0, 1) \\), the inequalities \\( y < 1 + x \\) and\
  \ \\( y > 1 - x \\) define a region bounded by \\( y = 1 - x \\) and \\( y = 1 +\
  \ x \\). The height of this region is \\( 2x \\), so the area is \\( \\int_{0}^{1}\
  \ 2x \\, dx = 1 \\).\n- For \\( x \\in (1, 3) \\), the inequalities \\( y < 1 +\
  \ x \\) and \\( y > x - 1 \\) define a region bounded by \\( y = x - 1 \\) and \\\
  ( y = 1 + x \\). The height of this region is \\( 2 \\), so the area is \\( \\int_{1}^{3}\
  \ 2 \\, dx = 4 \\).\n\nThus, the total area where the triangle inequalities are\
  \ satisfied is \\( 1 + 4 = 5 \\).\n\nThe probability is the ratio of the favorable\
  \ area to the total area:\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{5}{9}.\n\\]\n\nFinal\
  \ Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{5}{9}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
