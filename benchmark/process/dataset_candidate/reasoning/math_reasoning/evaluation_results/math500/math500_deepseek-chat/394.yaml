answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to analyze the function \( z(x, y) = (2x -
  y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y \) under the assumption that Archimedes chooses \( x \) to minimize
  \( z \), and Brahmagupta chooses \( y \) to maximize \( z \). We will use the concept
  of **minimax** to find the optimal value of \( x \).


  ---


  ### Step 1: Expand the function \( z(x, y) \)

  First, expand the expression for \( z(x, y) \):

  \[

  z(x, y) = (2x - y)^2 - 2y^2 - 3y.

  \]

  Expanding \( (2x - y)^2 \), we get:

  \[

  (2x - y)^2 = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2.

  \]

  Substitute this back into the expression for \( z(x, y) \):

  \[

  z(x, y) = 4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 - 2y^2 - 3y.

  \]

  Simplify the terms involving \( y \):

  \[

  z(x, y) = 4x^2 - 4xy - y^2 - 3y.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Find Brahmagupta''s optimal choice of \( y \)

  Brahmagupta aims to maximize \( z(x, y) \) for a given \( x \). To find the optimal
  \( y \), we treat \( x \) as a constant and take the derivative of \( z(x, y) \)
  with respect to \( y \), then set it to zero:

  \[

  \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -4x - 2y - 3 = 0.

  \]

  Solve for \( y \):

  \[

  -4x - 2y - 3 = 0 \implies y = -2x - \frac{3}{2}.

  \]

  This is Brahmagupta''s optimal choice of \( y \) for a given \( x \).


  ---


  ### Step 3: Substitute Brahmagupta''s optimal \( y \) into \( z(x, y) \)

  Substitute \( y = -2x - \frac{3}{2} \) into \( z(x, y) \):

  \[

  z(x, y) = 4x^2 - 4x(-2x - \frac{3}{2}) - (-2x - \frac{3}{2})^2 - 3(-2x - \frac{3}{2}).

  \]

  Simplify each term:

  1. \( -4x(-2x - \frac{3}{2}) = 8x^2 + 6x \).

  2. \( -(-2x - \frac{3}{2})^2 = -4x^2 - 6x - \frac{9}{4} \).

  3. \( -3(-2x - \frac{3}{2}) = 6x + \frac{9}{2} \).


  Combine all terms:

  \[

  z(x, y) = 4x^2 + 8x^2 + 6x - 4x^2 - 6x - \frac{9}{4} + 6x + \frac{9}{2}.

  \]

  Simplify further:

  \[

  z(x, y) = 8x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Find Archimedes'' optimal choice of \( x \)

  Archimedes aims to minimize \( z(x, y) \). Since \( z(x, y) = 8x^2 + 6x + \frac{9}{4}
  \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:

  \[

  \frac{dz}{dx} = 16x + 6 = 0.

  \]

  Solve for \( x \):

  \[

  16x + 6 = 0 \implies x = -\frac{6}{16} = -\frac{3}{8}.

  \]

  ### Final Answer:

  Archimedes should choose \( x = -\frac{3}{8} \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
