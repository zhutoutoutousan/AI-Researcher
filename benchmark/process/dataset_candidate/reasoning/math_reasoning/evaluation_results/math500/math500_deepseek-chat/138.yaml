answer: "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial\
  \ Setup**:\n   - Both Bob and Alice start with one ball of each color: blue, green,\
  \ orange, red, and violet. So, each bag initially has 5 balls.\n\n2. **Alice's Move**:\n\
  \   - Alice randomly selects one ball from her bag and puts it into Bob's bag. After\
  \ this move:\n     - Alice's bag has 4 balls.\n     - Bob's bag has 6 balls.\n\n\
  3. **Bob's Move**:\n   - Bob randomly selects one ball from his bag (which now has\
  \ 6 balls) and puts it into Alice's bag. After this move:\n     - Alice's bag will\
  \ have 5 balls again.\n     - Bob's bag will have 5 balls again.\n\n4. **Condition\
  \ for Bags to Be the Same**:\n   - For the contents of the two bags to be the same\
  \ after the exchange, the ball Alice gave to Bob must be the same as the ball Bob\
  \ gave back to Alice. This is the only way the two bags will end up with the same\
  \ set of balls.\n\n5. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The probability that Alice\
  \ selects a specific ball (say, the blue one) is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\).\n   - After\
  \ Alice gives this ball to Bob, Bob's bag has 6 balls, one of which is the same\
  \ color as the ball Alice gave him.\n   - The probability that Bob selects the same\
  \ ball (the one Alice gave him) is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n   - Therefore, the probability\
  \ that both events happen (Alice gives a specific ball to Bob, and Bob gives the\
  \ same ball back to Alice) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6}\
  \ = \\frac{1}{30}.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The probability that\
  \ the contents of the two bags are the same after the exchange is \\( \\frac{1}{30}\
  \ \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\). I hope it is\
  \ correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
