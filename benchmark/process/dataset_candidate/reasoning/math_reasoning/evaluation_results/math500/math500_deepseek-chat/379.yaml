answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine for which grade the number of\
  \ male bus riders is closest to \\(135\\%\\) of the number of female bus riders.\
  \ Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of male and female\
  \ bus riders for each grade:**\n   - Since there are 300 males and 300 females in\
  \ each grade, we can calculate the number of male and female bus riders by multiplying\
  \ the percentages by 300.\n\n2. **Calculate \\(135\\%\\) of the number of female\
  \ bus riders for each grade:**\n   - This is done by multiplying the number of female\
  \ bus riders by \\(1.35\\).\n\n3. **Compare the number of male bus riders to \\\
  (135\\%\\) of the number of female bus riders:**\n   - Find the absolute difference\
  \ between the number of male bus riders and \\(135\\%\\) of the number of female\
  \ bus riders for each grade.\n   - The grade with the smallest difference is the\
  \ answer.\n\nLet's perform these calculations step by step:\n\n---\n\n### \\(9^{\\\
  text{th}}\\) Grade:\n- **Male bus riders:** \\(41.1\\% \\times 300 = 123.3\\)\n\
  - **Female bus riders:** \\(39.4\\% \\times 300 = 118.2\\)\n- **\\(135\\%\\) of\
  \ female bus riders:** \\(118.2 \\times 1.35 = 159.57\\)\n- **Difference:** \\(|123.3\
  \ - 159.57| = 36.27\\)\n\n---\n\n### \\(10^{\\text{th}}\\) Grade:\n- **Male bus\
  \ riders:** \\(34.4\\% \\times 300 = 103.2\\)\n- **Female bus riders:** \\(33.1\\\
  % \\times 300 = 99.3\\)\n- **\\(135\\%\\) of female bus riders:** \\(99.3 \\times\
  \ 1.35 = 134.055\\)\n- **Difference:** \\(|103.2 - 134.055| = 30.855\\)\n\n---\n\
  \n### \\(11^{\\text{th}}\\) Grade:\n- **Male bus riders:** \\(20.6\\% \\times 300\
  \ = 61.8\\)\n- **Female bus riders:** \\(13.8\\% \\times 300 = 41.4\\)\n- **\\(135\\\
  %\\) of female bus riders:** \\(41.4 \\times 1.35 = 55.89\\)\n- **Difference:**\
  \ \\(|61.8 - 55.89| = 5.91\\)\n\n---\n\n### \\(12^{\\text{th}}\\) Grade:\n- **Male\
  \ bus riders:** \\(11.6\\% \\times 300 = 34.8\\)\n- **Female bus riders:** \\(8.6\\\
  % \\times 300 = 25.8\\)\n- **\\(135\\%\\) of female bus riders:** \\(25.8 \\times\
  \ 1.35 = 34.83\\)\n- **Difference:** \\(|34.8 - 34.83| = 0.03\\)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\
  The smallest difference occurs in the \\(12^{\\text{th}}\\) grade, where the difference\
  \ is \\(0.03\\). Therefore, the \\(12^{\\text{th}}\\) grade is the answer.\n\nFinal\
  \ Answer: The final answer is \\(12^{\\text{th}}\\) grade. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
