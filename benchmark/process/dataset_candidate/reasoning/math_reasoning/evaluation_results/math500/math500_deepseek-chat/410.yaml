answer: "To determine the nonzero value of \\( N \\) that makes the number \\( 21420N\
  \ \\) divisible by \\( 6 \\), we need to check the divisibility rules for both \\\
  ( 2 \\) and \\( 3 \\).\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by \\\
  ( 2 \\) if its last digit is even. Since \\( N \\) is the units digit, \\( N \\\
  ) must be even. The possible nonzero even digits are \\( 2, 4, 6, \\) and \\( 8\
  \ \\).\n\n2. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by \\( 3 \\) if the sum\
  \ of its digits is divisible by \\( 3 \\). The sum of the digits of \\( 21420N \\\
  ) is:\n   \\[\n   2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 0 + N = 9 + N\n   \\]\n   For the number to be\
  \ divisible by \\( 3 \\), \\( 9 + N \\) must be divisible by \\( 3 \\). Since \\\
  ( 9 \\) is already divisible by \\( 3 \\), \\( N \\) must also be divisible by \\\
  ( 3 \\).\n\n3. **Combining the conditions**: \\( N \\) must be even and divisible\
  \ by \\( 3 \\). The only nonzero digit that satisfies both conditions is \\( 6 \\\
  ).\n\nTherefore, the nonzero value of \\( N \\) that makes \\( 21420N \\) divisible\
  \ by \\( 6 \\) is \\( 6 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $6$. I hope it\
  \ is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
