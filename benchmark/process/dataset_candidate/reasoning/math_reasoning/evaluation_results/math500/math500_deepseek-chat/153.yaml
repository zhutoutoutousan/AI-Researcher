answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that three randomly
  chosen points from a 3x3 grid lie on the same straight line.


  **Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to choose 3 points from the grid.**


  The grid has 3 rows and 3 columns, so there are a total of \(3 \times 3 = 9\) points.
  The number of ways to choose 3 points from 9 is given by the combination formula:


  \[

  \text{Total ways} = \binom{9}{3} = \frac{9!}{3! \cdot 6!} = 84

  \]


  **Step 2: Determine the number of sets of 3 points that lie on the same straight
  line.**


  We need to count all possible lines (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) that pass
  through exactly 3 points on the grid.


  - **Horizontal lines:** There are 3 rows, and each row has exactly 3 points. So,
  there are 3 horizontal lines.

  - **Vertical lines:** Similarly, there are 3 columns, and each column has exactly
  3 points. So, there are 3 vertical lines.

  - **Diagonal lines:** There are 2 diagonals that pass through exactly 3 points (the
  main diagonal and the anti-diagonal).


  Thus, the total number of lines that pass through exactly 3 points is:


  \[

  \text{Total lines} = 3 (\text{horizontal}) + 3 (\text{vertical}) + 2 (\text{diagonal})
  = 8

  \]


  **Step 3: Calculate the probability.**


  The probability \(P\) that three randomly chosen points lie on the same straight
  line is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible
  outcomes:


  \[

  P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable lines}}{\text{Total number of ways to choose
  3 points}} = \frac{8}{84} = \frac{2}{21}

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\frac{2}{21}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
