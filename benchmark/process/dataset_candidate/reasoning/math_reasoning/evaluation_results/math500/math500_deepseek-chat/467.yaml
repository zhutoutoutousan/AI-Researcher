answer: 'To find the area of the shaded triangle, we can use the formula for the area
  of a triangle:


  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}

  \]


  From the diagram, the base of the shaded triangle is the horizontal distance from
  \( (0, 0) \) to \( (10, 0) \), which is \( 10 \) cm. The height of the shaded triangle
  is the vertical distance from the base to the highest point of the triangle, which
  is \( 3 \) cm.


  Substituting these values into the formula:


  \[

  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15

  \]


  Thus, the area of the shaded triangle is \( 15 \) square centimeters.


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(15\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
