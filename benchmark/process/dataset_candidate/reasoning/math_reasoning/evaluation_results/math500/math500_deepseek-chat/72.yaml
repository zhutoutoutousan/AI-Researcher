answer: "To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \\( r \\) of a sphere where\
  \ the volume and surface area are numerically equal.\n\n1. **Volume of a Sphere**:\
  \ The formula for the volume \\( V \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{4}{3}\
  \ \\pi r^3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Surface Area of a Sphere**: The formula for the surface\
  \ area \\( S \\) of a sphere is:\n   \\[\n   S = 4 \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set\
  \ Volume Equal to Surface Area**: Since the volume and surface area are numerically\
  \ equal, we set the two formulas equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{3} \\\
  pi r^3 = 4 \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation**: Divide both sides by\
  \ \\( 4 \\pi r^2 \\) (assuming \\( r \\neq 0 \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4}{3} \\pi\
  \ r^3 \\div 4 \\pi r^2 = 4 \\pi r^2 \\div 4 \\pi r^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we\
  \ get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{r}{3} = 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( r \\)**:\n   \\\
  [\n   r = 3\n   \\]\n\nThus, the radius of the sphere is \\( 3 \\) units.\n\nFinal\
  \ Answer: The final answer is \\(3\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
