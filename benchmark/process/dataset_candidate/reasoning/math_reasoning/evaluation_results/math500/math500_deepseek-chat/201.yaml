answer: "To solve this problem, we need to find all possible values of \\( N \\) that\
  \ satisfy the given conditions and then compute their sum.\n\n### Step 1: Translate\
  \ the problem into modular arithmetic\n1. When the students are divided into groups\
  \ of 8, the last group has 5 students. This means:\n   \\[\n   N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}.\n\
  \   \\]\n2. When the students are divided into groups of 6, the last group has 3\
  \ students. This means:\n   \\[\n   N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}.\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2:\
  \ Solve the system of congruences\nWe need to find all integers \\( N \\) such that:\n\
  \\[\nN \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8}, \\quad N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}, \\quad \\text{and} \\\
  quad N < 50.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2.1: Express \\( N \\) in terms of the first congruence\n\
  From \\( N \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\), we can write:\n\\[\nN = 8k + 5,\n\\]\nwhere\
  \ \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\n#### Step 2.2: Substitute into the second\
  \ congruence\nSubstitute \\( N = 8k + 5 \\) into \\( N \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\):\n\
  \\[\n8k + 5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}.\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n8k \\equiv -2 \\pmod{6}.\n\
  \\]\nSince \\( 8 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{6} \\), this becomes:\n\\[\n2k \\equiv -2 \\pmod{6}.\n\
  \\]\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nk \\equiv -1 \\pmod{3}.\n\\]\nThis is equivalent\
  \ to:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}.\n\\]\n\n#### Step 2.3: Express \\( k \\) in terms\
  \ of the second congruence\nFrom \\( k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3} \\), we can write:\n\\\
  [\nk = 3m + 2,\n\\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\n#### Step 2.4:\
  \ Substitute back to find \\( N \\)\nSubstitute \\( k = 3m + 2 \\) into \\( N =\
  \ 8k + 5 \\):\n\\[\nN = 8(3m + 2) + 5 = 24m + 16 + 5 = 24m + 21.\n\\]\n\n#### Step\
  \ 2.5: Find all possible values of \\( N \\) under 50\nWe need \\( N < 50 \\), so:\n\
  \\[\n24m + 21 < 50.\n\\]\nSubtract 21:\n\\[\n24m < 29.\n\\]\nDivide by 24:\n\\[\n\
  m < \\frac{29}{24} \\approx 1.208.\n\\]\nSince \\( m \\) is a non-negative integer,\
  \ the only possible value is \\( m = 0 \\).\n\nSubstitute \\( m = 0 \\) into \\\
  ( N = 24m + 21 \\):\n\\[\nN = 24(0) + 21 = 21.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Verify the solution\n\
  Check that \\( N = 21 \\) satisfies both conditions:\n1. \\( 21 \\div 8 = 2 \\)\
  \ with a remainder of 5, so \\( 21 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{8} \\).\n2. \\( 21 \\div 6 =\
  \ 3 \\) with a remainder of 3, so \\( 21 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6} \\).\n\nThus, \\( N\
  \ = 21 \\) is the only valid solution under 50.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the sum of\
  \ all possible values of \\( N \\)\nSince there is only one valid value of \\( N\
  \ \\), the sum is simply \\( 21 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(21\\\
  ). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
