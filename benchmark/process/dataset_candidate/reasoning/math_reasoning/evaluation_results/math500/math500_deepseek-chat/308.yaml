answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the surface area of one of the
  pieces created when a plane parallel to edges \( AB \) and \( CD \) and halfway
  between them cuts the regular tetrahedron \( ABCD \) with side length 2.


  ### Step 1: Understand the Geometry

  A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces. The plane parallel
  to edges \( AB \) and \( CD \) and halfway between them will intersect the tetrahedron
  in a way that creates two smaller, congruent pieces. Each piece will have:

  - One equilateral triangular face (from the original tetrahedron).

  - One rectangular face (from the cut).

  - Two trapezoidal faces (from the cut).


  ### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Equilateral Triangle

  The area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is given by:

  \[

  A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2

  \]

  For \( s = 2 \):

  \[

  A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 2^2 = \sqrt{3}

  \]


  ### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Rectangular Face

  The rectangular face is formed by the intersection of the plane with the tetrahedron.
  The height of the tetrahedron \( h \) is:

  \[

  h = \sqrt{2^2 - \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2} = \sqrt{4 - \frac{4}{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}}
  = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}

  \]

  The plane is halfway between \( AB \) and \( CD \), so the height of the rectangular
  face is \( \frac{h}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} \). The length of the rectangle is equal
  to the side length of the tetrahedron, which is 2. Thus, the area of the rectangular
  face is:

  \[

  \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} = \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3}

  \]


  ### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Trapezoidal Faces

  Each trapezoidal face has two parallel sides: one with length 2 (from the original
  tetrahedron) and one with length 1 (from the cut). The height of the trapezoid is
  the same as the height of the rectangular face, \( \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} \). The area
  of one trapezoidal face is:

  \[

  \text{Area}_{\text{trapezoid}} = \frac{1 + 2}{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} = \frac{3}{2}
  \times \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}

  \]

  Since there are two trapezoidal faces, the total area for both is:

  \[

  2 \times \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} = \sqrt{6}

  \]


  ### Step 5: Sum the Areas

  The total surface area of one piece is the sum of the areas of the equilateral triangle,
  the rectangular face, and the two trapezoidal faces:

  \[

  \text{Total Surface Area} = \sqrt{3} + \frac{2\sqrt{6}}{3} + \sqrt{6} = \sqrt{3}
  + \frac{5\sqrt{6}}{3}

  \]


  ### Final Answer

  Final Answer: The final answer is \( \sqrt{3} + \frac{5\sqrt{6}}{3} \). I hope it
  is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
