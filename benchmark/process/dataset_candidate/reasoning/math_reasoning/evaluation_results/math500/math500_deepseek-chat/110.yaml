answer: "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given sequence and its properties.\
  \ Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Sequence:**\n   -\
  \ The sequence \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots \\) is strictly increasing and consists\
  \ of positive integers.\n   - For every positive integer \\( k \\):\n     - The\
  \ subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1} \\) is geometric.\n     - The subsequence\
  \ \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\) is arithmetic.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Geometric\
  \ Subsequence:**\n   - For the geometric subsequence \\( a_{2k-1}, a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}\
  \ \\), there exists a common ratio \\( r \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     a_{2k} =\
  \ a_{2k-1} \\cdot r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} \\cdot r = a_{2k-1}\
  \ \\cdot r^2.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Analyzing the Arithmetic Subsequence:**\n   - For\
  \ the arithmetic subsequence \\( a_{2k}, a_{2k+1}, a_{2k+2} \\), there exists a\
  \ common difference \\( d \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d \\\
  quad \\text{and} \\quad a_{2k+2} = a_{2k+1} + d = a_{2k} + 2d.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Relating\
  \ the Two Subsequences:**\n   - From the geometric subsequence, we have \\( a_{2k+1}\
  \ = a_{2k-1} \\cdot r^2 \\).\n   - From the arithmetic subsequence, we have \\(\
  \ a_{2k+1} = a_{2k} + d \\).\n   - Since \\( a_{2k} = a_{2k-1} \\cdot r \\), we\
  \ can substitute:\n     \\[\n     a_{2k-1} \\cdot r^2 = a_{2k-1} \\cdot r + d.\n\
  \     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     a_{2k-1} (r^2 - r) = d.\n \
  \    \\]\n   - Since \\( d \\) is a positive integer and the sequence is strictly\
  \ increasing, \\( r \\) must be an integer greater than 1.\n\n5. **Determining the\
  \ Common Ratio \\( r \\):**\n   - Let's assume \\( r = 2 \\) (the smallest integer\
  \ greater than 1).\n   - Then, \\( d = a_{2k-1} (2^2 - 2) = 2a_{2k-1} \\).\n\n6.\
  \ **Building the Sequence:**\n   - Let \\( a_1 = x \\).\n   - Then:\n     \\[\n\
  \     a_2 = a_1 \\cdot 2 = 2x,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_3 = a_2 \\cdot 2 = 4x,\n\
  \     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_4 = a_3 + d = 4x + 2x = 6x,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n  \
  \   a_5 = a_4 \\cdot 2 = 12x,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_6 = a_5 + d = 12x + 2x\
  \ = 14x,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_7 = a_6 \\cdot 2 = 28x,\n     \\]\n     \\\
  [\n     a_8 = a_7 + d = 28x + 2x = 30x,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_9 = a_8 \\cdot\
  \ 2 = 60x,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_{10} = a_9 + d = 60x + 2x = 62x,\n     \\\
  ]\n     \\[\n     a_{11} = a_{10} \\cdot 2 = 124x,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_{12}\
  \ = a_{11} + d = 124x + 2x = 126x,\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     a_{13} = a_{12} \\\
  cdot 2 = 252x.\n     \\]\n\n7. **Using the Given Information:**\n   - We are given\
  \ that \\( a_{13} = 2016 \\).\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     252x = 2016 \\implies\
  \ x = \\frac{2016}{252} = 8.\n     \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The first term\
  \ of the sequence is \\( a_1 = 8 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $8$.\

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
