answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Let\
  \ the initial number of blue marbles be \\( 4x \\).\n   - Let the initial number\
  \ of yellow marbles be \\( 3x \\).\n   - The initial ratio of blue to yellow marbles\
  \ is \\( 4:3 \\).\n\n2. **After Adding and Removing Marbles:**\n   - Add 5 blue\
  \ marbles: the new number of blue marbles is \\( 4x + 5 \\).\n   - Remove 3 yellow\
  \ marbles: the new number of yellow marbles is \\( 3x - 3 \\).\n   - The new ratio\
  \ of blue to yellow marbles is \\( 7:3 \\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   \\\
  [\n   \\frac{4x + 5}{3x - 3} = \\frac{7}{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equation:**\n\
  \   - Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:\n     \\[\n     3(4x + 5) = 7(3x\
  \ - 3)\n     \\]\n   - Expand both sides:\n     \\[\n     12x + 15 = 21x - 21\n\
  \     \\]\n   - Rearrange to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     15 + 21 = 21x\
  \ - 12x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     36 = 9x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     x = 4\n    \
  \ \\]\n\n5. **Find the Initial Number of Blue Marbles:**\n   - The initial number\
  \ of blue marbles is \\( 4x = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(16\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
