answer: "To solve this problem, let's analyze the reflection of the parabola step\
  \ by step.\n\n1. **Original Parabola**:\n   The equation of the original parabola\
  \ is \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), and its vertex is at \\( (h, k) \\). Since the vertex\
  \ is at \\( (h, k) \\), the equation can also be written in vertex form:\n   \\\
  [\n   y = a(x - h)^2 + k.\n   \\]\n   Expanding this, we get:\n   \\[\n   y = a(x^2\
  \ - 2hx + h^2) + k = ax^2 - 2ahx + ah^2 + k.\n   \\]\n   Comparing this with \\\
  ( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), we see that:\n   \\[\n   b = -2ah \\quad \\text{and} \\\
  quad c = ah^2 + k.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Reflected Parabola**:\n   Reflecting the parabola\
  \ about the line \\( y = k \\) means that every point \\( (x, y) \\) on the original\
  \ parabola is mapped to \\( (x, 2k - y) \\) on the reflected parabola. Thus, the\
  \ equation of the reflected parabola is:\n   \\[\n   y = 2k - (ax^2 + bx + c) =\
  \ -ax^2 - bx - c + 2k.\n   \\]\n   Comparing this with \\( y = dx^2 + ex + f \\\
  ), we see that:\n   \\[\n   d = -a, \\quad e = -b, \\quad f = -c + 2k.\n   \\]\n\
  \n3. **Sum \\( a + b + c + d + e + f \\)**:\n   Substitute the values of \\( d \\\
  ), \\( e \\), and \\( f \\) into the sum:\n   \\[\n   a + b + c + d + e + f = a\
  \ + b + c + (-a) + (-b) + (-c + 2k).\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\\
  [\n   a + b + c - a - b - c + 2k = 2k.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum \\( a + b + c +\
  \ d + e + f \\) is \\( 2k \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(2k\\). I\
  \ hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
