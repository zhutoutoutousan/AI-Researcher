answer: 'To solve the inequality:


  \[

  \frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0,

  \]


  we analyze the numerator and the denominator separately.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Analyze the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\)

  The expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative because it is an absolute value.
  It equals zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which occurs at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).
  For all other values of \(x\), \(|x^2 - 81| > 0\).


  ---


  ### Step 2: Analyze the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\)

  The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x - 36)\). This expression
  equals zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). The denominator is positive when \(x <
  0\) or \(x > 36\), and negative when \(0 < x < 36\).


  ---


  ### Step 3: Combine the numerator and denominator

  The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) holds when the numerator and
  denominator have opposite signs. Since \(|x^2 - 81| \geq 0\), the inequality is
  satisfied only when:

  1. \(|x^2 - 81| > 0\) (i.e., \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\)), and

  2. \(x^2 - 36x < 0\) (i.e., \(0 < x < 36\)).


  Thus, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\), excluding \(x = 9\) (because at \(x = 9\),
  the numerator equals zero, making the expression undefined).


  ---


  ### Step 4: Write the solution

  The solution to the inequality is:

  \[

  0 < x < 9 \quad \text{or} \quad 9 < x < 36.

  \]

  Final Answer: The final answer is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
