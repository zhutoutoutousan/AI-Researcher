answer: "Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **First term (Term 1):** \
  \ \n   \\( 0 \\)\n\n2. **Second term (Term 2):**  \n   Add 1 to the first term:\
  \  \n   \\( 0 + 1 = 1 \\)\n\n3. **Third term (Term 3):**  \n   Multiply the second\
  \ term by 1:  \n   \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n\n4. **Fourth term (Term 4):**  \n \
  \  Add 2 to the third term:  \n   \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\n5. **Fifth term (Term 5):**\
  \  \n   Multiply the fourth term by 2:  \n   \\( 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)\n\n6. **Sixth\
  \ term (Term 6):**  \n   Add 3 to the fifth term:  \n   \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\)\n\n7.\
  \ **Seventh term (Term 7):**  \n   Multiply the sixth term by 3:  \n   \\( 9 \\\
  times 3 = 27 \\)\n\n8. **Eighth term (Term 8):**  \n   Add 4 to the seventh term:\
  \  \n   \\( 27 + 4 = 31 \\)\n\n9. **Ninth term (Term 9):**  \n   Multiply the eighth\

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
