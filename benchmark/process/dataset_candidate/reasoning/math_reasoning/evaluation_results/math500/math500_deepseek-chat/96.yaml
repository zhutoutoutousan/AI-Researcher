answer: 'To solve the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(x+1)(x-3)}{5(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{(x+3)(x-5)}{9(x+4)(x-6)} - \frac{2(x+5)(x-7)}{13(x+6)(x-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585},

  \]


  we will follow these steps:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Simplify the equation

  First, observe that the denominators on the left-hand side are all products of linear
  factors. To simplify the equation, we can find a common denominator for the three
  fractions. However, this approach would be computationally intensive due to the
  complexity of the denominators. Instead, we will look for a substitution or pattern
  that simplifies the equation.


  ---


  ### Step 2: Look for symmetry or substitution

  Notice that the numerators and denominators of each fraction are of the form \((x
  + a)(x - b)\). This suggests that we can rewrite the equation in terms of a new
  variable. Let:


  \[

  y = x + 1.

  \]


  This substitution shifts the equation to make the terms more symmetric. However,
  after testing this substitution, it does not significantly simplify the equation.
  Instead, we will proceed by cross-multiplying and simplifying.


  ---


  ### Step 3: Cross-multiply and combine terms

  Multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator (LCD) of the
  fractions. The LCD is:


  \[

  5 \cdot 9 \cdot 13 \cdot (x+2)(x-4)(x+4)(x-6)(x+6)(x-8).

  \]


  This step eliminates the denominators and results in a polynomial equation. However,
  this approach is computationally intensive and not practical for manual calculation.
  Instead, we will look for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.


  ---


  ### Step 4: Rational Root Theorem

  The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial equation
  must be a factor of the constant term divided by a factor of the leading coefficient.
  In this case, the equation is highly complex, and the Rational Root Theorem is not
  directly applicable. Instead, we will test simple integer values for \(x\) to see
  if they satisfy the equation.


  ---


  ### Step 5: Test integer values

  We test \(x = 0\):


  \[

  \frac{(0+1)(0-3)}{5(0+2)(0-4)} + \frac{(0+3)(0-5)}{9(0+4)(0-6)} - \frac{2(0+5)(0-7)}{13(0+6)(0-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(1)(-3)}{5(2)(-4)} + \frac{(3)(-5)}{9(4)(-6)} - \frac{2(5)(-7)}{13(6)(-8)}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{-3}{-40} + \frac{-15}{-216} - \frac{-70}{-624}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{3}{40} + \frac{15}{216} - \frac{70}{624}.

  \]


  Simplify the fractions:


  \[

  \frac{3}{40} + \frac{5}{72} - \frac{35}{312}.

  \]


  Find a common denominator (9360):


  \[

  \frac{3 \cdot 234}{9360} + \frac{5 \cdot 130}{9360} - \frac{35 \cdot 30}{9360}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{702}{9360} + \frac{650}{9360} - \frac{1050}{9360}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{702 + 650 - 1050}{9360} = \frac{302}{9360}.

  \]


  This does not equal \(\frac{92}{585}\), so \(x = 0\) is not a root.


  ---


  ### Step 6: Test \(x = 1\)

  Substitute \(x = 1\) into the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(1+1)(1-3)}{5(1+2)(1-4)} + \frac{(1+3)(1-5)}{9(1+4)(1-6)} - \frac{2(1+5)(1-7)}{13(1+6)(1-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(2)(-2)}{5(3)(-3)} + \frac{(4)(-4)}{9(5)(-5)} - \frac{2(6)(-6)}{13(7)(-7)}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{-4}{-45} + \frac{-16}{-225} - \frac{-72}{-637}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{4}{45} + \frac{16}{225} - \frac{72}{637}.

  \]


  Find a common denominator (143325):


  \[

  \frac{4 \cdot 3185}{143325} + \frac{16 \cdot 637}{143325} - \frac{72 \cdot 225}{143325}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{12740}{143325} + \frac{10192}{143325} - \frac{16200}{143325}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{12740 + 10192 - 16200}{143325} = \frac{6732}{143325}.

  \]


  This does not equal \(\frac{92}{585}\), so \(x = 1\) is not a root.


  ---


  ### Step 7: Test \(x = 2\)

  Substitute \(x = 2\) into the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(2+1)(2-3)}{5(2+2)(2-4)} + \frac{(2+3)(2-5)}{9(2+4)(2-6)} - \frac{2(2+5)(2-7)}{13(2+6)(2-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(3)(-1)}{5(4)(-2)} + \frac{(5)(-3)}{9(6)(-4)} - \frac{2(7)(-5)}{13(8)(-6)}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{-3}{-40} + \frac{-15}{-216} - \frac{-70}{-624}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{3}{40} + \frac{15}{216} - \frac{70}{624}.

  \]


  Simplify the fractions:


  \[

  \frac{3}{40} + \frac{5}{72} - \frac{35}{312}.

  \]


  Find a common denominator (9360):


  \[

  \frac{3 \cdot 234}{9360} + \frac{5 \cdot 130}{9360} - \frac{35 \cdot 30}{9360}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{702}{9360} + \frac{650}{9360} - \frac{1050}{9360}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{702 + 650 - 1050}{9360} = \frac{302}{9360}.

  \]


  This does not equal \(\frac{92}{585}\), so \(x = 2\) is not a root.


  ---


  ### Step 8: Test \(x = 3\)

  Substitute \(x = 3\) into the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(3+1)(3-3)}{5(3+2)(3-4)} + \frac{(3+3)(3-5)}{9(3+4)(3-6)} - \frac{2(3+5)(3-7)}{13(3+6)(3-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(4)(0)}{5(5)(-1)} + \frac{(6)(-2)}{9(7)(-3)} - \frac{2(8)(-4)}{13(9)(-5)}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{0}{-25} + \frac{-12}{-189} - \frac{-64}{-585}.

  \]


  \[

  0 + \frac{12}{189} - \frac{64}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify the fractions:


  \[

  0 + \frac{4}{63} - \frac{64}{585}.

  \]


  Find a common denominator (4095):


  \[

  0 + \frac{4 \cdot 65}{4095} - \frac{64 \cdot 7}{4095}.

  \]


  \[

  0 + \frac{260}{4095} - \frac{448}{4095}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{260 - 448}{4095} = \frac{-188}{4095}.

  \]


  This does not equal \(\frac{92}{585}\), so \(x = 3\) is not a root.


  ---


  ### Step 9: Test \(x = 4\)

  Substitute \(x = 4\) into the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(4+1)(4-3)}{5(4+2)(4-4)} + \frac{(4+3)(4-5)}{9(4+4)(4-6)} - \frac{2(4+5)(4-7)}{13(4+6)(4-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(5)(1)}{5(6)(0)} + \frac{(7)(-1)}{9(8)(-2)} - \frac{2(9)(-3)}{13(10)(-4)}.

  \]


  The first term is undefined because the denominator is zero. Therefore, \(x = 4\)
  is not a valid root.


  ---


  ### Step 10: Test \(x = 5\)

  Substitute \(x = 5\) into the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(5+1)(5-3)}{5(5+2)(5-4)} + \frac{(5+3)(5-5)}{9(5+4)(5-6)} - \frac{2(5+5)(5-7)}{13(5+6)(5-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(6)(2)}{5(7)(1)} + \frac{(8)(0)}{9(9)(-1)} - \frac{2(10)(-2)}{13(11)(-3)}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{12}{35} + 0 - \frac{-40}{-429}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{12}{35} - \frac{40}{429}.

  \]


  Find a common denominator (15015):


  \[

  \frac{12 \cdot 429}{15015} - \frac{40 \cdot 35}{15015}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{5148}{15015} - \frac{1400}{15015}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{5148 - 1400}{15015} = \frac{3748}{15015}.

  \]


  This does not equal \(\frac{92}{585}\), so \(x = 5\) is not a root.


  ---


  ### Step 11: Test \(x = 6\)

  Substitute \(x = 6\) into the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(6+1)(6-3)}{5(6+2)(6-4)} + \frac{(6+3)(6-5)}{9(6+4)(6-6)} - \frac{2(6+5)(6-7)}{13(6+6)(6-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(7)(3)}{5(8)(2)} + \frac{(9)(1)}{9(10)(0)} - \frac{2(11)(-1)}{13(12)(-2)}.

  \]


  The second term is undefined because the denominator is zero. Therefore, \(x = 6\)
  is not a valid root.


  ---


  ### Step 12: Test \(x = 7\)

  Substitute \(x = 7\) into the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(7+1)(7-3)}{5(7+2)(7-4)} + \frac{(7+3)(7-5)}{9(7+4)(7-6)} - \frac{2(7+5)(7-7)}{13(7+6)(7-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(8)(4)}{5(9)(3)} + \frac{(10)(2)}{9(11)(1)} - \frac{2(12)(0)}{13(13)(-1)}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{32}{135} + \frac{20}{99} - 0.

  \]


  Simplify the fractions:


  \[

  \frac{32}{135} + \frac{20}{99}.

  \]


  Find a common denominator (1485):


  \[

  \frac{32 \cdot 11}{1485} + \frac{20 \cdot 15}{1485}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{352}{1485} + \frac{300}{1485}.

  \]


  \[

  \frac{352 + 300}{1485} = \frac{652}{1485}.

  \]


  This does not equal \(\frac{92}{585}\), so \(x = 7\) is not a root.


  ---


  ### Step 13: Test \(x = 8\)

  Substitute \(x = 8\) into the equation:


  \[

  \frac{(8+1)(8-3)}{5(8+2)(8-4)} + \frac{(8+3)(8-5)}{9(8+4)(8-6)} - \frac{2(8+5)(8-7)}{13(8+6)(8-8)}
  = \frac{92}{585}.

  \]


  Simplify each term:


  \[

  \frac{(9)(5)}{5(10)(4)} + \frac{(11)(3)}{9(12)(2)} - \frac{2(13)(1)}{13(14)(0)}.

  \]


  The third term is undefined because the denominator is zero. Therefore, \(x = 8\)
  is not a valid root.


  ---


  ### Step 14: Conclusion

  After testing integer values from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 8\), none of them satisfy the
  equation. This suggests that the equation may not have simple rational roots. To
  find the real roots, we would need to use numerical methods or graphing techniques,
  which are beyond the scope of this solution.
