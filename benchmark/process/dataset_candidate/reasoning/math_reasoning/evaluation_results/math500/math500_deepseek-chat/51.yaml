answer: "To find the quotient when \\( x^6 - 3 \\) is divided by \\( x + 1 \\), we\
  \ can use **polynomial long division** or **synthetic division**. Here, we will\
  \ use **synthetic division** for simplicity.\n\n### Step 1: Set up synthetic division\n\
  The divisor is \\( x + 1 \\), so we use \\( -1 \\) as the root in synthetic division.\
  \ The polynomial \\( x^6 - 3 \\) can be written as:\n\\[\nx^6 + 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3\
  \ + 0x^2 + 0x - 3.\n\\]\nThe coefficients are: \\( 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -3 \\).\n\n\
  ### Step 2: Perform synthetic division\n1. Bring down the first coefficient: \\\
  ( 1 \\).\n2. Multiply \\( 1 \\) by \\( -1 \\) and add to the next coefficient:\n\
  \   \\[\n   0 + (-1 \\cdot 1) = -1.\n   \\]\n3. Multiply \\( -1 \\) by \\( -1 \\\
  ) and add to the next coefficient:\n   \\[\n   0 + (-1 \\cdot -1) = 1.\n   \\]\n\
  4. Multiply \\( 1 \\) by \\( -1 \\) and add to the next coefficient:\n   \\[\n \
  \  0 + (-1 \\cdot 1) = -1.\n   \\]\n5. Multiply \\( -1 \\) by \\( -1 \\) and add\
  \ to the next coefficient:\n   \\[\n   0 + (-1 \\cdot -1) = 1.\n   \\]\n6. Multiply\
  \ \\( 1 \\) by \\( -1 \\) and add to the next coefficient:\n   \\[\n   0 + (-1 \\\
  cdot 1) = -1.\n   \\]\n7. Multiply \\( -1 \\) by \\( -1 \\) and add to the last\
  \ coefficient:\n   \\[\n   -3 + (-1 \\cdot -1) = -2.\n   \\]\n\nThe resulting coefficients\
  \ are: \\( 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -2 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Interpret the result\nThe\
  \ quotient is a polynomial of degree \\( 5 \\) (one less than the original polynomial).\
  \ Using the coefficients from synthetic division, the quotient is:\n\\[\nx^5 - x^4\
  \ + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1.\n\\]\nThe remainder is \\( -2 \\), but we are only asked\
  \ for the quotient.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe final answer is \\( x^5 - x^4 + x^3\
  \ - x^2 + x - 1 \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
