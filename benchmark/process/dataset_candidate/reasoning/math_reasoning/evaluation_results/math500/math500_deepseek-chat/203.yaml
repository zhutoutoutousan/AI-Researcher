answer: "To find the remainder when the polynomial \\( P(x) = (5x + 9)^{611} + (x\
  \ + 5)^{11} + (x - 1)^{11} + 3x^2 + 1 \\) is divided by \\( x + 2 \\), we can use\
  \ the **Remainder Theorem**. The Remainder Theorem states that the remainder of\
  \ a polynomial \\( P(x) \\) divided by \\( x - a \\) is equal to \\( P(a) \\). Here,\
  \ the divisor is \\( x + 2 \\), which can be rewritten as \\( x - (-2) \\). Thus,\
  \ the remainder is \\( P(-2) \\).\n\nLet's compute \\( P(-2) \\):\n\n1. Compute\
  \ \\( (5x + 9)^{611} \\) at \\( x = -2 \\):\n   \\[\n   5(-2) + 9 = -10 + 9 = -1.\n\
  \   \\]\n   So, \\( (5x + 9)^{611} \\) evaluated at \\( x = -2 \\) is \\( (-1)^{611}\
  \ = -1 \\).\n\n2. Compute \\( (x + 5)^{11} \\) at \\( x = -2 \\):\n   \\[\n   -2\
  \ + 5 = 3.\n   \\]\n   So, \\( (x + 5)^{11} \\) evaluated at \\( x = -2 \\) is \\\
  ( 3^{11} \\).\n\n3. Compute \\( (x - 1)^{11} \\) at \\( x = -2 \\):\n   \\[\n  \
  \ -2 - 1 = -3.\n   \\]\n   So, \\( (x - 1)^{11} \\) evaluated at \\( x = -2 \\)\
  \ is \\( (-3)^{11} = -3^{11} \\).\n\n4. Compute \\( 3x^2 \\) at \\( x = -2 \\):\n\
  \   \\[\n   3(-2)^2 = 3(4) = 12.\n   \\]\n\n5. The constant term is \\( 1 \\).\n\
  \nNow, combine all the terms:\n\\[\nP(-2) = (-1) + 3^{11} + (-3^{11}) + 12 + 1.\n\
  \\]\nNotice that \\( 3^{11} \\) and \\( -3^{11} \\) cancel each other out, leaving:\n\
  \\[\nP(-2) = -1 + 12 + 1 = 12.\n\\]\n\nThus, the remainder is \\( 12 \\).\n\nFinal\
  \ Answer: The final answer is $12$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
