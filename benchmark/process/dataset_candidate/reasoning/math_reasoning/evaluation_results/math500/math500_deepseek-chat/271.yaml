answer: 'To compute \(997^{-1}\) modulo \(1000\), we need to find an integer \(x\)
  such that:


  \[

  997x \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}.

  \]


  This means we need to solve for \(x\) in the equation:


  \[

  997x - 1000y = 1,

  \]


  where \(y\) is some integer. We can use the **Extended Euclidean Algorithm** to
  solve this.


  ### Step 1: Apply the Euclidean Algorithm

  First, we compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(997\) and \(1000\):


  \[

  1000 = 997 \cdot 1 + 3,

  \]

  \[

  997 = 3 \cdot 332 + 1,

  \]

  \[

  3 = 1 \cdot 3 + 0.

  \]


  The gcd is \(1\), so the inverse exists.


  ### Step 2: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm

  Now, we work backwards to express \(1\) as a combination of \(997\) and \(1000\):


  From the second equation:

  \[

  1 = 997 - 3 \cdot 332.

  \]


  From the first equation:

  \[

  3 = 1000 - 997 \cdot 1.

  \]


  Substitute \(3\) into the previous equation:

  \[

  1 = 997 - (1000 - 997 \cdot 1) \cdot 332,

  \]

  \[

  1 = 997 - 1000 \cdot 332 + 997 \cdot 332,

  \]

  \[

  1 = 997 \cdot 333 - 1000 \cdot 332.

  \]


  Thus, \(x = 333\) is a solution to \(997x \equiv 1 \pmod{1000}\).


  ### Step 3: Verify the Solution

  We verify:

  \[

  997 \cdot 333 = 332001.

  \]


  Now, compute \(332001 \mod 1000\):

  \[

  332001 \mod 1000 = 1.

  \]


  This confirms that \(x = 333\) is indeed the inverse of \(997\) modulo \(1000\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is $333$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
