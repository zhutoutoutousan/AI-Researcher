answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much milk remains in the\
  \ bucket after Sam walks 3 miles, given that the bucket loses \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\\
  ) of its milk each mile.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Initial Amount of\
  \ Milk:**\n   - Sam starts with 2 gallons of milk.\n\n2. **Leakage Rate:**\n   -\
  \ For each mile, the bucket retains \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the milk it had at the\
  \ beginning of the mile.\n\n3. **Calculation After Each Mile:**\n   - **After 1\
  \ mile:** The remaining milk is \\(2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}\\) gallons.\n\
  \   - **After 2 miles:** The remaining milk is \\(\\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{3}\
  \ = \\frac{8}{9}\\) gallons.\n   - **After 3 miles:** The remaining milk is \\(\\\
  frac{8}{9} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{16}{27}\\) gallons.\n\n4. **Final Amount\
  \ of Milk:**\n   - After 3 miles, the bucket contains \\(\\frac{16}{27}\\) gallons\
  \ of milk.\n\n### Final Answer:\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\frac{16}{27}\\\
  ). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
