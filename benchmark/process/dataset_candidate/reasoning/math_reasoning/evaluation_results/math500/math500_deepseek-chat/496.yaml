answer: 'To find \( |w| \), we start by substituting \( z = 1 + i \) into the expression
  for \( w \):


  \[

  w = \frac{3z + 1}{5z + 7}.

  \]


  First, compute \( 3z + 1 \):


  \[

  3z + 1 = 3(1 + i) + 1 = 3 + 3i + 1 = 4 + 3i.

  \]


  Next, compute \( 5z + 7 \):


  \[

  5z + 7 = 5(1 + i) + 7 = 5 + 5i + 7 = 12 + 5i.

  \]


  Now, \( w \) becomes:


  \[

  w = \frac{4 + 3i}{12 + 5i}.

  \]


  To find \( |w| \), we use the property that \( |w| = \left| \frac{4 + 3i}{12 + 5i}
  \right| = \frac{|4 + 3i|}{|12 + 5i|} \).


  First, compute \( |4 + 3i| \):


  \[

  |4 + 3i| = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5.

  \]


  Next, compute \( |12 + 5i| \):


  \[

  |12 + 5i| = \sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{144 + 25} = \sqrt{169} = 13.

  \]


  Thus, \( |w| \) is:


  \[

  |w| = \frac{5}{13}.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\frac{5}{13}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
