answer: 'To find the average price of Juan''s 70''s stamps, we need to calculate the
  total cost of all the 70''s stamps and then divide by the total number of 70''s
  stamps.


  ### Step 1: Identify the number of 70''s stamps for each country.

  From the table:

  - Brazil: 12 stamps

  - France: 12 stamps

  - Peru: 6 stamps

  - Spain: 13 stamps


  ### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 70''s stamps for each country.

  - Brazil: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents

  - France: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents

  - Peru: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cents

  - Spain: \(13 \times 5 = 65\) cents


  ### Step 3: Sum the total cost of all 70''s stamps.

  \[

  72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233 \text{ cents}

  \]


  ### Step 4: Calculate the total number of 70''s stamps.

  \[

  12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \text{ stamps}

  \]


  ### Step 5: Compute the average price.

  \[

  \text{Average price} = \frac{233}{43} \approx 5.4186 \text{ cents}

  \]


  ### Step 6: Round to the nearest tenth of a cent.

  \[

  5.4186 \approx 5.4 \text{ cents}

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is $5.4$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\

  Juan organizes the stamps in his collection by country and by the decade in which
  they were issued. The prices he paid for them at a stamp shop were: Brazil and France,
  $6$ cents each, Peru $4$ cents each, and Spain $5$ cents each. (Brazil and Peru
  are South American countries and France and Spain are in Europe.) [asy]
