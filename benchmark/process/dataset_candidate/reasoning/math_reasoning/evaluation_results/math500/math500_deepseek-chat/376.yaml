answer: "To determine the coordinates of point \\( P \\) on the line \\( y = -x +\
  \ 6 \\) such that \\( P \\) is equidistant from points \\( A(10, -10) \\) and \\\
  ( O(0, 0) \\), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express \\( P \\) in terms of \\(\
  \ x \\):**\n   Since \\( P \\) lies on the line \\( y = -x + 6 \\), its coordinates\
  \ can be written as \\( P(x, -x + 6) \\).\n\n2. **Set up the distance equations:**\n\
  \   The distance from \\( P \\) to \\( A(10, -10) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   PA = \\sqrt{(x\
  \ - 10)^2 + (-x + 6 - (-10))^2} = \\sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2}.\n   \\]\n  \
  \ The distance from \\( P \\) to \\( O(0, 0) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   PO = \\sqrt{x^2\
  \ + (-x + 6)^2}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Equate the distances:**\n   Since \\( PA = PO \\\
  ), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + (-x + 6)^2}.\n\
  \   \\]\n   Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots gives:\n   \\[\n \
  \  (x - 10)^2 + (-x + 16)^2 = x^2 + (-x + 6)^2.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Expand and simplify:**\n\
  \   Expand both sides:\n   \\[\n   (x^2 - 20x + 100) + (x^2 - 32x + 256) = x^2 +\
  \ (x^2 - 12x + 36).\n   \\]\n   Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   2x^2 - 52x + 356\
  \ = 2x^2 - 12x + 36.\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\( 2x^2 \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n\
  \   -52x + 356 = -12x + 36.\n   \\]\n   Rearrange to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\\
  [\n   -52x + 12x = 36 - 356,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -40x = -320,\n   \\]\n   \\[\n\
  \   x = 8.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Find \\( y \\):**\n   Substitute \\( x = 8 \\) into \\\
  ( y = -x + 6 \\):\n   \\[\n   y = -8 + 6 = -2.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n \
  \  The coordinates of \\( P \\) are \\( (8, -2) \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is \\((8, -2)\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
