answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the side length of an equilateral triangle
  inscribed in the parabola \( x^2 = 8y \), with one vertex at the vertex of the parabola.


  ### Step 1: Identify the vertex of the parabola

  The vertex of the parabola \( x^2 = 8y \) is at the origin \((0, 0)\).


  ### Step 2: Parametrize the other two vertices

  Since the triangle is equilateral and inscribed in the parabola, the other two vertices
  must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let the other two vertices be \((x,
  y)\) and \((-x, y)\).


  ### Step 3: Use the equation of the parabola

  Since \((x, y)\) lies on the parabola, it satisfies \( x^2 = 8y \). Thus, \( y =
  \frac{x^2}{8} \).


  ### Step 4: Calculate the distance between vertices

  The distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((x, y)\) is:

  \[

  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{x^2}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{x^4}{64}}.

  \]


  The distance between \((x, y)\) and \((-x, y)\) is:

  \[

  \sqrt{(2x)^2} = 2x.

  \]


  Since the triangle is equilateral, these distances must be equal:

  \[

  \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{x^4}{64}} = 2x.

  \]


  ### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)

  Square both sides:

  \[

  x^2 + \frac{x^4}{64} = 4x^2.

  \]

  Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:

  \[

  \frac{x^4}{64} = 3x^2.

  \]

  Multiply both sides by 64:

  \[

  x^4 = 192x^2.

  \]

  Divide both sides by \( x^2 \) (since \( x \neq 0 \)):

  \[

  x^2 = 192.

  \]

  Thus, \( x = \sqrt{192} = 8\sqrt{3} \).


  ### Step 6: Find the side length

  The side length of the equilateral triangle is \( 2x = 2 \times 8\sqrt{3} = 16\sqrt{3}
  \).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(16\sqrt{3}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
