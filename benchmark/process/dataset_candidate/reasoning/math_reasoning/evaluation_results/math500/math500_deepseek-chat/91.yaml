answer: "To determine the smallest possible integer value for \\( x \\) such that\
  \ \\( f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x-1}}{x-2} \\) has a real number value, we need to consider\
  \ the following:\n\n1. **Square Root in the Numerator**: The expression inside the\
  \ square root, \\( x-1 \\), must be non-negative. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   x - 1 \\\
  geq 0 \\implies x \\geq 1.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Denominator**: The denominator \\( x-2\
  \ \\) cannot be zero, so:\n   \\[\n   x - 2 \\neq 0 \\implies x \\neq 2.\n   \\\
  ]\n\nCombining these two conditions, \\( x \\) must satisfy \\( x \\geq 1 \\) and\
  \ \\( x \\neq 2 \\). The smallest integer that satisfies these conditions is \\\
  ( x = 1 \\).\n\nLet's verify \\( x = 1 \\):\n\\[\nf(1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-1}}{1-2}\
  \ = \\frac{0}{-1} = 0.\n\\]\nThis is a real number value, so \\( x = 1 \\) is valid.\n\
  \nThe next integer is \\( x = 3 \\), but since \\( x = 1 \\) already works and is\
  \ smaller, we don't need to consider larger values.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(1\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
