answer: 'To solve for \( p(8) \), we can use the method of polynomial interpolation.
  Given that \( p(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 5 and satisfies \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2
  - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \), we can construct a polynomial that fits
  these points and then evaluate it at \( x = 8 \).


  ### Step 1: Rewrite the given condition

  The condition \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) can be rewritten as:

  \[

  p(n) = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n+1)}.

  \]

  This suggests that \( p(x) \) can be expressed as:

  \[

  p(x) = \frac{x}{(x-1)(x+1)} \cdot q(x),

  \]

  where \( q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 3 (since \( p(x) \) is degree 5 and \(
  \frac{x}{(x-1)(x+1)} \) is degree -1, so \( q(x) \) must be degree 3 to make \(
  p(x) \) degree 5).


  ### Step 2: Use the given points to solve for \( q(x) \)

  We know \( p(n) = \frac{n}{n^2 - 1} \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Substituting
  these into the equation:

  \[

  \frac{n}{(n-1)(n+1)} = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n+1)} \cdot q(n).

  \]

  This simplifies to:

  \[

  q(n) = 1 \quad \text{for} \quad n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

  \]

  Since \( q(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 3 and equals 1 at 6 distinct points,
  it must be the constant polynomial \( q(x) = 1 \).


  ### Step 3: Write the explicit form of \( p(x) \)

  Thus, the polynomial \( p(x) \) is:

  \[

  p(x) = \frac{x}{(x-1)(x+1)}.

  \]


  ### Step 4: Evaluate \( p(8) \)

  Now, substitute \( x = 8 \) into the polynomial:

  \[

  p(8) = \frac{8}{(8-1)(8+1)} = \frac{8}{7 \cdot 9} = \frac{8}{63}.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\frac{8}{63}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
