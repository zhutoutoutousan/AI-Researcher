answer: "To find the maximum value of the expression\n\\[\n\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4\
  \ + 6},\n\\]\nwe can analyze the numerator and denominator separately.\n\n1. **Numerator\
  \ Analysis**: The numerator \\(x - y\\) can be positive or negative depending on\
  \ the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). To maximize the expression, we want \\(x -\
  \ y\\) to be as large as possible.\n\n2. **Denominator Analysis**: The denominator\
  \ \\(x^4 + y^4 + 6\\) is always positive because \\(x^4\\) and \\(y^4\\) are non-negative\
  \ for all real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and 6 is a positive constant. To maximize\
  \ the expression, we want the denominator to be as small as possible.\n\n3. **Optimizing\
  \ the Expression**: To maximize \\(\\frac{x - y}{x^4 + y^4 + 6}\\), we need to maximize\
  \ \\(x - y\\) while minimizing \\(x^4 + y^4\\). The minimum value of \\(x^4 + y^4\\\
  ) occurs when \\(x = y = 0\\), but this would make the numerator \\(x - y = 0\\\
  ), resulting in the expression being 0, which is not the maximum.\n\n   Instead,\
  \ consider the case where \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = -1\\):\n   \\[\n   x - y = 1 -\
  \ (-1) = 2,\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   x^4 + y^4 = 1^4 + (-1)^4 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\
  \   \\]\n   Thus, the expression becomes\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{2 + 6} = \\frac{2}{8}\
  \ = \\frac{1}{4}.\n   \\]\n\n   This is a candidate for the maximum value. To confirm\
  \ that this is indeed the maximum, we can test other values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\\
  ). For example, if \\(x = 2\\) and \\(y = 1\\), then\n   \\[\n   x - y = 2 - 1 =\
  \ 1,\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   x^4 + y^4 = 16 + 1 = 17.\n   \\]\n   The expression\
  \ becomes\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{17 + 6} = \\frac{1}{23},\n   \\]\n   which is less\
  \ than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n   Similarly, if \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 0\\), then\n\
  \   \\[\n   x - y = 1 - 0 = 1,\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   x^4 + y^4 = 1 + 0 = 1.\n\
  \   \\]\n   The expression becomes\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{1 + 6} = \\frac{1}{7},\n\
  \   \\]\n   which is also less than \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\n   Therefore, the maximum\
  \ value of the expression is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
