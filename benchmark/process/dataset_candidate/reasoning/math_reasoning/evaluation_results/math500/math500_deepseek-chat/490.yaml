answer: 'To find the least possible value of \(|a_{n-1}|\) for the polynomial \(f(x)
  = 2x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + 66\) with distinct integer roots, we proceed
  as follows:


  1. **Roots of the Polynomial**: Let the distinct integer roots of \(f(x)\) be \(r_1,
  r_2, \dots, r_n\). Since the polynomial has integer coefficients and the leading
  coefficient \(a_n = 2\), the roots must satisfy certain divisibility conditions.
  Specifically, the product of the roots \(r_1 r_2 \dots r_n\) must divide \(a_0 /
  a_n = 66 / 2 = 33\).


  2. **Possible Roots**: The divisors of 33 are \(\pm1, \pm3, \pm11, \pm33\). We need
  to select \(n\) distinct integers from this set such that their product is \(33\).


  3. **Minimizing \(|a_{n-1}|\)**: The coefficient \(a_{n-1}\) is related to the sum
  of the roots. Specifically, \(a_{n-1} = -2 \cdot (\text{sum of the roots})\). To
  minimize \(|a_{n-1}|\), we need to minimize the absolute value of the sum of the
  roots.


  4. **Optimal Root Selection**: The smallest possible absolute sum occurs when the
  roots are \(1, -1, 3, -11\). The sum of these roots is \(1 + (-1) + 3 + (-11) =
  -8\). Thus, \(a_{n-1} = -2 \cdot (-8) = 16\).


  5. **Verification**: The product of these roots is \(1 \cdot (-1) \cdot 3 \cdot
  (-11) = 33\), which satisfies the condition \(a_0 / a_n = 33\).


  Therefore, the least possible value of \(|a_{n-1}|\) is \(16\).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
