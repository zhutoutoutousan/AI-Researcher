answer: 'We are given the following system of equations:

  \[

  \begin{align*}

  a + b &= 8, \\

  b + c &= -3, \\

  a + c &= -5.

  \end{align*}

  \]


  To solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we can add all three equations:

  \[

  (a + b) + (b + c) + (a + c) = 8 + (-3) + (-5).

  \]

  Simplifying the left side:

  \[

  2a + 2b + 2c = 0.

  \]

  Divide both sides by 2:

  \[

  a + b + c = 0.

  \]


  Now, we can solve for each variable individually:

  1. From \(a + b + c = 0\) and \(a + b = 8\), we substitute \(a + b = 8\) into the
  equation:

  \[

  8 + c = 0 \implies c = -8.

  \]


  2. From \(a + b + c = 0\) and \(b + c = -3\), we substitute \(b + c = -3\) into
  the equation:

  \[

  a + (-3) = 0 \implies a = 3.

  \]


  3. From \(a + b + c = 0\) and \(a + c = -5\), we substitute \(a + c = -5\) into
  the equation:

  \[

  b + (-5) = 0 \implies b = 5.

  \]


  Now that we have \(a = 3\), \(b = 5\), and \(c = -8\), we can compute the product
  \(abc\):

  \[

  abc = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot (-8) = -120.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(-120\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
