answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that
  the probability of exactly two dice showing a number other than 1 is \( \frac{25}{216}
  \).


  ### Step 1: Understand the probability of a single die

  - The probability that a single die shows a number other than 1 is \( \frac{5}{6}
  \).

  - The probability that a single die shows 1 is \( \frac{1}{6} \).


  ### Step 2: Use the binomial probability formula

  The probability that exactly two dice show a number other than 1 (and the remaining
  \( n-2 \) dice show 1) is given by the binomial probability formula:


  \[

  P = \binom{n}{2} \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2}

  \]


  We are given that \( P = \frac{25}{216} \), so we can set up the equation:


  \[

  \binom{n}{2} \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2} = \frac{25}{216}

  \]


  ### Step 3: Simplify the equation

  First, simplify \( \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 \):


  \[

  \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 = \frac{25}{36}

  \]


  Now, substitute this back into the equation:


  \[

  \binom{n}{2} \cdot \frac{25}{36} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2} = \frac{25}{216}

  \]


  Divide both sides by \( \frac{25}{36} \):


  \[

  \binom{n}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2} = \frac{25}{216} \div \frac{25}{36}
  = \frac{1}{6}

  \]


  So, we have:


  \[

  \binom{n}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2} = \frac{1}{6}

  \]


  ### Step 4: Solve for \( n \)

  We know that \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), so substitute this into the
  equation:


  \[

  \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2} = \frac{1}{6}

  \]


  Multiply both sides by 2:


  \[

  n(n-1) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

  \]


  Now, we can test small integer values of \( n \) to find the solution.


  - For \( n = 3 \):


  \[

  3 \cdot 2 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{1} = 6 \cdot \frac{1}{6} = 1 \neq \frac{1}{3}

  \]


  - For \( n = 4 \):


  \[

  4 \cdot 3 \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{2} = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{36} = \frac{12}{36}
  = \frac{1}{3}

  \]


  This matches the equation, so \( n = 4 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
