answer: 'To compute the expression:


  \[

  \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ},

  \]


  we can use trigonometric identities and properties to simplify the problem.

  ### Step 1: Recall the identity for \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}\)

  The identity for \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}\) is:


  \[

  \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = \sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta.

  \]


  Thus, the first term becomes:


  \[

  \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Recall the identity for \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\)

  The identity for \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\) is:


  \[

  \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta.

  \]


  Thus, the second and third terms become:


  \[

  \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,

  \]

  \[

  \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Combine the terms

  Now, the original expression becomes:


  \[

  1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.

  \]


  Simplify this to:


  \[

  3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Use trigonometric identities to simplify further

  Using the identity \(\tan(90^\circ - \theta) = \cot \theta\), we can rewrite \(\cot^2
  20^\circ\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) as:


  \[

  \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ,

  \]

  \[

  \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 50^\circ.

  \]


  Thus, the expression becomes:


  \[

  3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 5: Use the identity for \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ\)

  It is known that:


  \[

  \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

  \]


  Thus, the expression simplifies to:


  \[

  3 + 9 = 12.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
