answer: "To solve this problem, we need to find Rosa's age that satisfies the following\
  \ conditions:\n1. When her age is divided by 2, 3, 4, or 6, the remainder is 1.\n\
  2. When her age is divided by 7, the remainder is 0.\n3. Her age is less than 75.\n\
  \nLet's break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the first\
  \ condition\nThe first condition states that when Rosa's age is divided by 2, 3,\
  \ 4, or 6, the remainder is 1. This means Rosa's age is 1 more than a multiple of\
  \ 2, 3, 4, and 6. In other words, Rosa's age minus 1 must be a common multiple of\
  \ 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\nThe least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 6 is 12. Therefore,\
  \ Rosa's age minus 1 must be a multiple of 12. Let\u2019s denote Rosa's age as \\\
  ( x \\). Then:\n\\[\nx - 1 = 12k,\n\\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is a positive integer. This\
  \ means:\n\\[\nx = 12k + 1.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Incorporate the second condition\n\
  The second condition states that when Rosa's age is divided by 7, the remainder\
  \ is 0. This means Rosa's age is a multiple of 7. Using the expression from Step\
  \ 1:\n\\[\nx = 12k + 1,\n\\]\nwe substitute into the second condition:\n\\[\n12k\
  \ + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\nSimplify this congruence:\n\\[\n12k \\equiv -1\
  \ \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\nSince \\( 12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7} \\), we can rewrite the congruence\
  \ as:\n\\[\n5k \\equiv -1 \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by the modular inverse\
  \ of 5 modulo 7. The inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3 because \\( 5 \\cdot 3 = 15 \\equiv\
  \ 1 \\pmod{7} \\). Thus:\n\\[\nk \\equiv -3 \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\nSince \\( -3 \\equiv\
  \ 4 \\pmod{7} \\), we have:\n\\[\nk \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}.\n\\]\nThis means \\( k\
  \ = 7m + 4 \\), where \\( m \\) is a non-negative integer.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3:\
  \ Substitute back to find \\( x \\)\nSubstitute \\( k = 7m + 4 \\) into \\( x =\
  \ 12k + 1 \\):\n\\[\nx = 12(7m + 4) + 1 = 84m + 48 + 1 = 84m + 49.\n\\]\nThus, Rosa's\
  \ age is:\n\\[\nx = 84m + 49.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Apply the third condition\n\
  The third condition states that Rosa's age is less than 75. Therefore:\n\\[\n84m\
  \ + 49 < 75.\n\\]\nSolve for \\( m \\):\n\\[\n84m < 26,\n\\]\n\\[\nm < \\frac{26}{84}.\n\
  \\]\nSince \\( m \\) is a non-negative integer, the only possible value is \\( m\
  \ = 0 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find Rosa's age\nSubstitute \\( m = 0 \\) into\
  \ \\( x = 84m + 49 \\):\n\\[\nx = 84(0) + 49 = 49.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Verify\
  \ the solution\n1. \\( 49 \\div 2 = 24 \\) with a remainder of 1.\n2. \\( 49 \\\
  div 3 = 16 \\) with a remainder of 1.\n3. \\( 49 \\div 4 = 12 \\) with a remainder\
  \ of 1.\n4. \\( 49 \\div 6 = 8 \\) with a remainder of 1.\n5. \\( 49 \\div 7 = 7\
  \ \\) with a remainder of 0.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied.\n\n---\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\( 49 \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
