answer: "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of integer values of\
  \ \\( k \\) in the interval \\([-500, 500]\\) for which the equation \\(\\log(kx)\
  \ = 2\\log(x+2)\\) has exactly one real solution.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the equation\n\
  The given equation is:\n\\[\n\\log(kx) = 2\\log(x+2)\n\\]\n\nUsing the logarithm\
  \ power rule, \\( 2\\log(x+2) = \\log((x+2)^2) \\), so the equation becomes:\n\\\
  [\n\\log(kx) = \\log((x+2)^2)\n\\]\n\nSince the logarithm function is one-to-one,\
  \ we can equate the arguments:\n\\[\nkx = (x+2)^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Rearrange\
  \ the equation\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\\[\nkx = x^2 + 4x + 4\n\\]\n\nRearrange\
  \ the equation to form a quadratic equation:\n\\[\nx^2 + (4 - k)x + 4 = 0\n\\]\n\
  \n### Step 3: Analyze the quadratic equation\nFor the equation \\( x^2 + (4 - k)x\
  \ + 4 = 0 \\) to have exactly one real solution, the discriminant must be zero.\
  \ The discriminant \\( D \\) of a quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is\
  \ given by:\n\\[\nD = b^2 - 4ac\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 4 - k\
  \ \\), and \\( c = 4 \\):\n\\[\nD = (4 - k)^2 - 4(1)(4) = (4 - k)^2 - 16\n\\]\n\n\
  Set the discriminant to zero for exactly one real solution:\n\\[\n(4 - k)^2 - 16\
  \ = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\( k \\)\nExpand and solve the equation:\n\\\
  [\n(4 - k)^2 = 16\n\\]\n\\[\n4 - k = \\pm 4\n\\]\n\nThis gives two cases:\n1. \\\
  ( 4 - k = 4 \\) \u2192 \\( k = 0 \\)\n2. \\( 4 - k = -4 \\) \u2192 \\( k = 8 \\\
  )\n\n### Step 5: Verify the solutions\nWe must ensure that these values of \\( k\
  \ \\) do not make the original equation undefined. The original equation involves\
  \ \\(\\log(kx)\\) and \\(\\log(x+2)\\), so:\n- \\( kx > 0 \\) and \\( x + 2 > 0\
  \ \\).\n\nFor \\( k = 0 \\):\n- The equation \\(\\log(0 \\cdot x)\\) is undefined,\
  \ so \\( k = 0 \\) is invalid.\n\nFor \\( k = 8 \\):\n- The equation becomes \\\
  ( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0 \\), which has a double root at \\( x = 2 \\). This satisfies\
  \ \\( x + 2 > 0 \\) and \\( kx = 8 \\cdot 2 = 16 > 0 \\), so \\( k = 8 \\) is valid.\n\
  \n### Step 6: Count the valid \\( k \\) values\nThe only valid integer value of\
  \ \\( k \\) in the interval \\([-500, 500]\\) is \\( k = 8 \\).\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is $1$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
