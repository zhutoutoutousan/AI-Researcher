answer: 'To find the maximum value of the function

  \[

  f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2},

  \]

  where \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\), we can proceed with the following steps:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Use Trigonometric Substitution

  Let \(x = \sin \alpha\) and \(y = \sin \beta\), where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are
  angles in the range \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\). This substitution ensures
  that \(x\) and \(y\) lie in the interval \([-1, 1]\), and the square roots are well-defined:

  \[

  \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \cos \alpha,

  \]

  \[

  \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \cos \beta.

  \]


  Substituting into \(f(x, y)\), we get:

  \[

  f(x, y) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Simplify the Expression

  The expression \(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha\) is a well-known
  trigonometric identity:

  \[

  \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos \alpha = \sin(\alpha + \beta).

  \]

  Thus, the function simplifies to:

  \[

  f(x, y) = \sin(\alpha + \beta).

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Maximize the Function

  The maximum value of \(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\) is \(1\), since the sine function
  attains its maximum value of \(1\) when its argument is \(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k\)
  for any integer \(k\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(f(x, y)\) is \(1\).


  ---


  ### Step 4: Verify the Maximum

  To verify that this maximum is achievable, consider the case where \(\alpha + \beta
  = \frac{\pi}{2}\). For example, let \(\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(\beta = 0\).
  Then:

  \[

  x = \sin \alpha = \sin \frac{\pi}{2} = 1,

  \]

  \[

  y = \sin \beta = \sin 0 = 0.

  \]

  Substituting into \(f(x, y)\), we get:

  \[

  f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot
  0 = 1.

  \]

  Thus, the maximum value \(1\) is achievable.

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
