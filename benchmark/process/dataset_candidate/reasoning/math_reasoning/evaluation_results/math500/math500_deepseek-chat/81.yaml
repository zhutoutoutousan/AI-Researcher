answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n-\
  \ Let \\( T \\) represent the weight of one trekk.\n- Let \\( S \\) represent the\
  \ weight of one squig.\n- Let \\( G \\) represent the weight of one goolee.\n\n\
  **Step 2: Translate the Problem into Equations**\n1. Ten treeks weigh as much as\
  \ three squigs and one goolee:\n   \\[\n   10T = 3S + G \\quad \\text{(Equation\
  \ 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:\n\
  \   \\[\n   2T + G = S \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for\
  \ \\( G \\) in Equation 2**\nFrom Equation 2:\n\\[\nG = S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:\
  \ Substitute \\( G \\) into Equation 1**\nSubstitute \\( G = S - 2T \\) into Equation\
  \ 1:\n\\[\n10T = 3S + (S - 2T)\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n10T = 4S - 2T\n\\]\n\n**Step\
  \ 5: Solve for \\( S \\) in Terms of \\( T \\)**\nAdd \\( 2T \\) to both sides:\n\
  \\[\n12T = 4S\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\\[\n3T = S\n\\]\n\n**Step 6: Interpret\
  \ the Result**\nThis means that one squig (\\( S \\)) weighs the same as three treeks\
  \ (\\( 3T \\)).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\( 3 \\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
