answer: 'To determine the units digit of the superfactorial \(4\$\), we need to understand
  the structure of \(4\$\). The superfactorial \(4\$\) is defined as:


  \[

  4\$ = \underbrace{4!^{4!^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4!}}}}}}_{4!}

  \]


  First, calculate \(4!\):


  \[

  4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24

  \]


  Now, \(4\$\) is a tower of exponents where \(4! = 24\) is the base and the exponent
  is also \(24\), repeated \(24\) times. However, we only need to find the units digit
  of this enormous number. To do this, we can focus on the units digit of the base
  and how it behaves under exponentiation.


  The units digit of \(24\) is \(4\). We need to determine the units digit of \(4^{4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\),
  where the exponent tower has \(24\) levels.


  The key observation is that the units digit of powers of \(4\) cycles every 2 exponents:


  \[

  4^1 \equiv 4 \pmod{10}, \quad 4^2 \equiv 6 \pmod{10}, \quad 4^3 \equiv 4 \pmod{10},
  \quad 4^4 \equiv 6 \pmod{10}, \quad \ldots

  \]


  Thus, the units digit of \(4^k\) is \(4\) if \(k\) is odd and \(6\) if \(k\) is
  even.


  Now, consider the exponent tower \(4^{4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\). The
  exponent at each level is \(4\), which is even. Therefore, the units digit of \(4^{4^{4^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{4}}}}}}\)
  will be \(6\) because the exponent is even.


  Thus, the units digit of \(4\$\) is \(6\).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
