answer: 'To determine the unordered set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3
  + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\), we can use the relationships
  between the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) and its coefficients.


  ### Step 1: Vieta''s Formulas

  For a quartic equation of the form \(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\), the sums
  and products of the roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are related
  to the coefficients as follows:

  1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a\),

  2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 +
  \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b\),

  3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4
  + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c\),

  4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d\).


  For the given polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), the coefficients are:

  - \(a = 2\),

  - \(b = 0\),

  - \(c = 0\),

  - \(d = 2\).


  Thus:

  1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\),

  2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 +
  \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\),

  3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4
  + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\),

  4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\).


  ### Step 2: Compute the Desired Sums

  We are interested in the sums \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3
  + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let \(S = \alpha_1\alpha_2
  + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(T = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(U = \alpha_1\alpha_4
  + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).


  From Vieta''s second formula, we know:

  \[

  \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4
  + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

  \]

  This can be rewritten as:

  \[

  S + T + U = 0.

  \]


  ### Step 3: Compute \(S \cdot T \cdot U\)

  Using the relationships between the roots, we can compute \(S \cdot T \cdot U\).
  However, this is not necessary for this problem because we can directly compute
  the unordered set.


  ### Step 4: Compute \(S\), \(T\), and \(U\)

  From the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we can factor it as:

  \[

  x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 + 2x + 2).

  \]

  The roots of \(x^2 + 1 = 0\) are \(i\) and \(-i\), and the roots of \(x^2 + 2x +
  2 = 0\) are \(-1 + i\) and \(-1 - i\). Thus, the four roots are:

  \[

  \alpha_1 = i, \quad \alpha_2 = -i, \quad \alpha_3 = -1 + i, \quad \alpha_4 = -1
  - i.

  \]


  Now compute the sums:

  1. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = (i)(-i) + (-1 + i)(-1 - i) = 1 + (1 +
  1) = 3\),

  2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = (i)(-1 + i) + (-i)(-1 - i) = (-i - 1)
  + (i - 1) = -2\),

  3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = (i)(-1 - i) + (-i)(-1 + i) = (-i + 1)
  + (i + 1) = 2\).


  Thus, the unordered set is \(\{-2, 2, 3\}\).


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\{-2, 2, 3\}\). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\

  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
