answer: 'To solve for \( x \), we analyze the given logarithmic equations step by
  step.


  ---


  ### Step 1: Solve the first equation

  The first equation is:

  \[

  \log_6 (x-y) + \log_6 (x+y) = 2.

  \]

  Using the logarithm property \(\log_b A + \log_b B = \log_b (AB)\), we combine the
  terms:

  \[

  \log_6 \big((x-y)(x+y)\big) = 2.

  \]

  This simplifies to:

  \[

  (x-y)(x+y) = 6^2 = 36.

  \]

  Expanding the left-hand side:

  \[

  x^2 - y^2 = 36. \quad \text{(Equation 1)}

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Solve the second equation

  The second equation is:

  \[

  \log_y (5x) = 2.

  \]

  This can be rewritten in exponential form:

  \[

  y^2 = 5x. \quad \text{(Equation 2)}

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Substitute \( y^2 \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1

  From Equation 2, we have \( y^2 = 5x \). Substitute this into Equation 1:

  \[

  x^2 - 5x = 36.

  \]

  Rearrange the equation:

  \[

  x^2 - 5x - 36 = 0.

  \]

  This is a quadratic equation. Solve for \( x \) using the quadratic formula:

  \[

  x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 144}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{169}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 13}{2}.

  \]

  The solutions are:

  \[

  x = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{-8}{2} = -4.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Verify the solutions

  Since \( \log_y (5x) = 2 \) requires \( y > 0 \) and \( y \neq 1 \), and \( y^2
  = 5x \), \( x \) must be positive. Thus, \( x = -4 \) is invalid. The valid solution
  is:

  \[

  x = 9.

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
