answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange
  7 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas (3 specific people)
  do not sit next to each other. Here''s the step-by-step reasoning:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Total number of unrestricted arrangements

  For circular arrangements, the number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a
  round table is \((n-1)!\). This is because rotations of the same arrangement are
  considered identical. For \( n = 7 \), the total number of arrangements is:

  \[

  (7-1)! = 6! = 720.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Subtract arrangements where at least two of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas
  sit together

  We use the principle of **inclusion-exclusion** to subtract the cases where at least
  two of the three people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) sit together.


  #### Case 1: Two specific people sit together

  - Treat the two people who sit together as a single "block." This reduces the problem
  to arranging \( 6 \) blocks (the pair and the other 5 individuals) around the table.

  - The number of ways to arrange \( 6 \) blocks in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

  - The two people in the block can switch places, so multiply by \( 2 \).

  - There are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) ways to choose which two of the three people
  sit together.

  - Thus, the total number of arrangements for this case is:

  \[

  3 \cdot 2 \cdot 5! = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 120 = 720.

  \]


  #### Case 2: All three people sit together

  - Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single "block." This reduces the problem to
  arranging \( 5 \) blocks (the trio and the other 4 individuals) around the table.

  - The number of ways to arrange \( 5 \) blocks in a circle is \((5-1)! = 4! = 24\).

  - The three people in the block can be arranged in \( 3! = 6 \) ways.

  - Thus, the total number of arrangements for this case is:

  \[

  3! \cdot 4! = 6 \cdot 24 = 144.

  \]


  #### Apply inclusion-exclusion

  The total number of arrangements where at least two of the three people sit together
  is:

  \[

  \text{Case 1} - \text{Case 2} = 720 - 144 = 576.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Subtract from total arrangements

  Subtract the number of arrangements where at least two of the three people sit together
  from the total number of arrangements:

  \[

  720 - 576 = 144.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Verify the result

  We have calculated that there are \( 144 \) valid arrangements where no two of Pierre,
  Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other.

  Final Answer: The final answer is \( 144 \). I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
