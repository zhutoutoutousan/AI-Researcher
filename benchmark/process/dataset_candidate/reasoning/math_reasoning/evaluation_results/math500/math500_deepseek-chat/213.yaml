answer: "To compute the sum \n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{F_{n + 1}}{F_n F_{n\
  \ + 2}},\n\\]\nwhere \\( F_n \\) denotes the \\( n \\)-th Fibonacci number, we can\
  \ proceed as follows:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the general term\nThe general\
  \ term of the sum is:\n\\[\n\\frac{F_{n + 1}}{F_n F_{n + 2}}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the\
  \ Fibonacci recurrence relation \\( F_{n + 2} = F_{n + 1} + F_n \\), we rewrite\
  \ the denominator:\n\\[\nF_n F_{n + 2} = F_n (F_{n + 1} + F_n) = F_n F_{n + 1} +\
  \ F_n^2.\n\\]\n\nHowever, this does not immediately simplify the term. Instead,\
  \ consider the identity:\n\\[\n\\frac{F_{n + 1}}{F_n F_{n + 2}} = \\frac{1}{F_n}\
  \ - \\frac{1}{F_{n + 2}}.\n\\]\n\nThis identity can be verified by cross-multiplying:\n\
  \\[\n\\frac{1}{F_n} - \\frac{1}{F_{n + 2}} = \\frac{F_{n + 2} - F_n}{F_n F_{n +\
  \ 2}}.\n\\]\n\nUsing the Fibonacci recurrence relation \\( F_{n + 2} = F_{n + 1}\
  \ + F_n \\), we have:\n\\[\nF_{n + 2} - F_n = F_{n + 1}.\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\\
  frac{F_{n + 2} - F_n}{F_n F_{n + 2}} = \\frac{F_{n + 1}}{F_n F_{n + 2}},\n\\]\n\
  which confirms the identity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Write the sum as a telescoping\
  \ series\nUsing the identity, the sum becomes:\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{F_{n\
  \ + 1}}{F_n F_{n + 2}} = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{F_n} - \\frac{1}{F_{n\
  \ + 2}} \\right).\n\\]\n\nThis is a telescoping series. Writing out the first few\
  \ terms:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{F_1} - \\frac{1}{F_3} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{F_2}\
  \ - \\frac{1}{F_4} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{F_3} - \\frac{1}{F_5} \\right) +\
  \ \\cdots.\n\\]\n\nMost terms cancel out, and the sum simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{F_1}\
  \ + \\frac{1}{F_2}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the remaining terms\nThe\
  \ Fibonacci sequence starts with \\( F_1 = 1 \\) and \\( F_2 = 1 \\). Thus:\n\\\
  [\n\\frac{1}{F_1} + \\frac{1}{F_2} = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\
  The sum converges to \\( 2 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $2$. I hope\
  \ it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
