answer: "To solve the problem, we need to find the points of intersection of the two\
  \ given equations and then compute the sum of their distances from the point \\\
  ((-3, 2)\\).\n\n### Step 1: Rewrite the equations in standard form\n1. The first\
  \ equation is:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + y^2 + 6x - 24y + 72 = 0\n   \\]\n   Complete the\
  \ square for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 24y = -72\n   \\\
  ]\n   \\[\n   (x^2 + 6x + 9) + (y^2 - 24y + 144) = -72 + 9 + 144\n   \\]\n   \\\
  [\n   (x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81\n   \\]\n   This is a circle with center \\((-3,\
  \ 12)\\) and radius \\(9\\).\n\n2. The second equation is:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - y^2\
  \ + 6x + 16y - 46 = 0\n   \\]\n   Rearrange terms:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + 6x - y^2 +\
  \ 16y = 46\n   \\]\n   Complete the square for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n  \
  \ (x^2 + 6x + 9) - (y^2 - 16y + 64) = 46 + 9 - 64\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (x + 3)^2\
  \ - (y - 8)^2 = -9\n   \\]\n   This is a hyperbola centered at \\((-3, 8)\\).\n\n\
  ### Step 2: Find the points of intersection\nTo find the points of intersection,\
  \ solve the system of equations:\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2 + (y - 12)^2 = 81\n\\]\n\\[\n(x\
  \ + 3)^2 - (y - 8)^2 = -9\n\\]\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\
  \\[\n(y - 12)^2 + (y - 8)^2 = 90\n\\]\nExpand and simplify:\n\\[\n(y^2 - 24y + 144)\
  \ + (y^2 - 16y + 64) = 90\n\\]\n\\[\n2y^2 - 40y + 208 = 90\n\\]\n\\[\n2y^2 - 40y\
  \ + 118 = 0\n\\]\nDivide by 2:\n\\[\ny^2 - 20y + 59 = 0\n\\]\nSolve for \\(y\\):\n\
  \\[\ny = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{400 - 236}}{2} = \\frac{20 \\pm \\sqrt{164}}{2} =\
  \ 10 \\pm \\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(y = 10 \\pm \\sqrt{41}\\) into the hyperbola\
  \ equation:\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2 - (10 \\pm \\sqrt{41} - 8)^2 = -9\n\\]\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2\
  \ - (2 \\pm \\sqrt{41})^2 = -9\n\\]\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2 - (4 \\pm 4\\sqrt{41} + 41)\
  \ = -9\n\\]\n\\[\n(x + 3)^2 = 36 \\pm 4\\sqrt{41}\n\\]\n\\[\nx + 3 = \\pm \\sqrt{36\
  \ \\pm 4\\sqrt{41}}\n\\]\n\\[\nx = -3 \\pm \\sqrt{36 \\pm 4\\sqrt{41}}\n\\]\n\n\
  Thus, the four points of intersection are:\n\\[\n\\left(-3 \\pm \\sqrt{36 \\pm 4\\\
  sqrt{41}}, 10 \\pm \\sqrt{41}\\right)\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Compute the sum of distances\n\
  The point \\((-3, 2)\\) is the center of the hyperbola. The sum of the distances\
  \ from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is constant. Here, the foci are at\
  \ \\((-3, 2)\\) and \\((-3, 14)\\), and the constant sum is \\(2a = 18\\).\n\nSince\
  \ there are four points of intersection, the sum of their distances to \\((-3, 2)\\\
  ) is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 9 = 36\n\\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(36\\).\
  \ I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
