answer: 'To solve the problem, we need to find the quadratic polynomial \( p(x) \)
  with integer coefficients that has \( 4 - \sqrt{11} \) as a root. Then, we will
  compute \( \frac{p(3)}{p(4)} \).


  ---


  ### Step 1: Find the quadratic polynomial \( p(x) \)

  Since \( 4 - \sqrt{11} \) is a root of \( p(x) \), and \( p(x) \) has integer coefficients,
  the conjugate \( 4 + \sqrt{11} \) must also be a root. Thus, the polynomial can
  be written as:

  \[

  p(x) = a(x - (4 - \sqrt{11}))(x - (4 + \sqrt{11}))

  \]

  where \( a \) is an integer.


  Expand the polynomial:

  \[

  p(x) = a(x - 4 + \sqrt{11})(x - 4 - \sqrt{11})

  \]

  \[

  p(x) = a((x - 4)^2 - (\sqrt{11})^2)

  \]

  \[

  p(x) = a(x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11)

  \]

  \[

  p(x) = a(x^2 - 8x + 5)

  \]


  Since the problem does not specify a leading coefficient, we can assume \( a = 1
  \) for simplicity. Thus:

  \[

  p(x) = x^2 - 8x + 5

  \]

  ### Step 2: Compute \( p(3) \) and \( p(4) \)

  Evaluate \( p(3) \):

  \[

  p(3) = (3)^2 - 8(3) + 5

  \]

  \[

  p(3) = 9 - 24 + 5

  \]

  \[

  p(3) = -10

  \]


  Evaluate \( p(4) \):

  \[

  p(4) = (4)^2 - 8(4) + 5

  \]

  \[

  p(4) = 16 - 32 + 5

  \]

  \[

  p(4) = -11

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{p(3)}{p(4)} \)

  \[

  \frac{p(3)}{p(4)} = \frac{-10}{-11} = \frac{10}{11}

  \]

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
