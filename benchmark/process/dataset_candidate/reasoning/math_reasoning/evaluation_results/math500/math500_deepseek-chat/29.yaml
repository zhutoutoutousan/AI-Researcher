answer: "To determine the number of different battalions that can be sent, we need\
  \ to calculate the number of ways to choose 4 upper class soldiers out of 5 and\
  \ 8 lower class soldiers out of 10. This is a combination problem because the order\
  \ in which the soldiers are chosen does not matter.\n\n1. **Choosing Upper Class\
  \ Soldiers:**\n   The number of ways to choose 4 upper class soldiers out of 5 is\
  \ given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{5}{4} = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!}\
  \ = \\frac{5}{1} = 5\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choosing Lower Class Soldiers:**\n   The number\
  \ of ways to choose 8 lower class soldiers out of 10 is given by the combination\
  \ formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{10}{8} = \\frac{10!}{8!(10-8)!} = \\frac{10 \\times\
  \ 9}{2 \\times 1} = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Number of Battalions:**\n   The total\
  \ number of different battalions is the product of the two combinations:\n   \\\
  [\n   \\text{Total Battalions} = \\binom{5}{4} \\times \\binom{10}{8} = 5 \\times\
  \ 45 = 225\n   \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $225$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
  \nProblem:\nThe Greek army contained two types of soldiers: the upper class and\

  \ demands a force of 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers, how many\
  \ different battalions can be sent?\n\nPlease given your final answer (answer ONLY)\
  \ within the format of `Final Answer: The final answer is <answer>. I hope it is\
