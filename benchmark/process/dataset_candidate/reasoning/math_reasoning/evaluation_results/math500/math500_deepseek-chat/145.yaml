answer: 'To solve the problem, let''s start by analyzing the given equation:


  \[

  z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.

  \]


  Let \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Then the equation becomes:


  \[

  z + \frac{1}{z} = \alpha.

  \]


  Multiply both sides by \( z \) to obtain a quadratic equation:


  \[

  z^2 + 1 = \alpha z.

  \]


  Rearranging terms gives:


  \[

  z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0.

  \]


  This is a quadratic equation in \( z \). The solutions to this equation are:


  \[

  z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2}.

  \]


  Since \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we can compute \( \alpha^2 \):


  \[

  \alpha^2 = \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} =
  \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.

  \]


  Thus, the discriminant \( \alpha^2 - 4 \) is:


  \[

  \alpha^2 - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \frac{-5
  + \sqrt{5}}{2}.

  \]


  This means the solutions for \( z \) are:


  \[

  z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2}.

  \]


  However, instead of explicitly solving for \( z \), we can observe that \( z + \frac{1}{z}
  = \alpha \) implies that \( z \) lies on the unit circle in the complex plane, and
  \( z \) can be expressed as \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). Then:


  \[

  z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta = \alpha.

  \]


  Thus:


  \[

  \cos\theta = \frac{\alpha}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.

  \]


  Now, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \),
  we have:


  \[

  z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta).

  \]


  To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we can use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \(
  \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). However, computing \( \cos(85\theta) \)
  directly is not straightforward. Instead, we can use the recurrence relation for
  \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \).


  Let \( S_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \). We know that:


  \[

  S_1 = \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.

  \]


  The recurrence relation for \( S_n \) is:


  \[

  S_{n+1} = \alpha S_n - S_{n-1}.

  \]


  Using this recurrence, we can compute \( S_{85} \). However, computing \( S_{85}
  \) directly would be time-consuming. Instead, we can observe that \( \alpha = \frac{1
  + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, and the sequence \( S_n \) follows the Fibonacci
  sequence.


  Specifically, \( S_n = F_n \), where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number.
  Since \( S_1 = 1 \) and \( S_2 = \alpha^2 - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{-1
  + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we can see that \( S_n \) corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence.


  Thus, \( S_{85} = F_{85} \), where \( F_{85} \) is the 85th Fibonacci number. The
  85th Fibonacci number is a very large number, but we can express the answer in terms
  of \( \alpha \):


  \[

  z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \alpha^{85}.

  \]


  However, since \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), and \( \alpha^{85} \) is a
  very large number, we can conclude that:


  \[

  z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \alpha^{85}.

  \]


  Thus, the final answer is:


  \[

  \boxed{\alpha^{85}}.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is \(\alpha^{85}\). I hope it is correct.'
