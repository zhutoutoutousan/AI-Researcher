answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the variables:**\n \
  \  - Let \\( A \\) be Amy's current age.\n   - Let \\( B \\) be Ben's current age.\n\
  \   - Let \\( C \\) be Chris's current age.\n\n2. **Use the average age:**\n   The\
  \ average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 6. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{A\
  \ + B + C}{3} = 6 \\implies A + B + C = 18.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the information\
  \ about Chris:**\n   Four years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy is now. Therefore:\n\
  \   \\[\n   C - 4 = A \\implies C = A + 4.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Use the information about\
  \ Ben:**\n   In four years, Ben's age will be \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\) of Amy's age at\
  \ that time. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   B + 4 = \\frac{3}{5}(A + 4).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute\
  \ \\( C = A + 4 \\) into the first equation:**\n   \\[\n   A + B + (A + 4) = 18\
  \ \\implies 2A + B + 4 = 18 \\implies 2A + B = 14.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve the equation\
  \ for \\( B \\):**\n   From \\( 2A + B = 14 \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   B = 14 - 2A.\n\
  \   \\]\n\n7. **Substitute \\( B = 14 - 2A \\) into the equation from step 4:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   (14 - 2A) + 4 = \\frac{3}{5}(A + 4) \\implies 18 - 2A = \\frac{3}{5}(A\
  \ + 4).\n   \\]\n\n8. **Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the fraction:**\n\
  \   \\[\n   5(18 - 2A) = 3(A + 4) \\implies 90 - 10A = 3A + 12.\n   \\]\n\n9. **Solve\
  \ for \\( A \\):**\n   \\[\n   90 - 10A = 3A + 12 \\implies 90 - 12 = 13A \\implies\
  \ 78 = 13A \\implies A = 6.\n   \\]\n\n10. **Find \\( C \\) using \\( C = A + 4\
  \ \\):**\n    \\[\n    C = 6 + 4 = 10.\n    \\]\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer\
  \ is \\(10\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
