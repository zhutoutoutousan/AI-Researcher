answer: 'To solve this problem, we can interpret the given equations as distances
  between points in a plane. Let''s denote the points as \( P_1 = (x_1, y_1) \), \(
  P_2 = (x_2, y_2) \), and \( P_3 = (x_3, y_3) \). The given equations represent the
  squared distances between these points:


  1. \( (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = 9 \) implies that the distance between \(
  P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) is \( 3 \).

  2. \( (x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2 = 16 \) implies that the distance between \(
  P_1 \) and \( P_3 \) is \( 4 \).

  3. \( (x_2 - x_3)^2 + (y_2 - y_3)^2 = 25 \) implies that the distance between \(
  P_2 \) and \( P_3 \) is \( 5 \).


  These distances satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, so the points \( P_1 \), \( P_2
  \), and \( P_3 \) form a right triangle with sides \( 3 \), \( 4 \), and \( 5 \).


  The determinant of the matrix

  \[

  \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}

  \]

  is twice the area of the triangle formed by the points \( P_1 \), \( P_2 \), and
  \( P_3 \). Since the triangle is right-angled, its area is \( \frac{1}{2} \times
  3 \times 4 = 6 \). Therefore, the determinant is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \).


  Squaring the determinant gives:

  \[

  \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \\ x_3 & y_3 & 1 \end{vmatrix}^2
  = 12^2 = 144.

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is $144$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
