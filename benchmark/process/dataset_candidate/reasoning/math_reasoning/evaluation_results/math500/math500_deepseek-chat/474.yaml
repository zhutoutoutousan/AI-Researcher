answer: 'To solve the problem, we can use the change of base formula for logarithms.
  The change of base formula states that:


  \[

  \log_a{b} = \frac{\log_c{b}}{\log_c{a}}

  \]


  Using this formula, we can rewrite each term in the product:


  \[

  \log_2{3} = \frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}}, \quad \log_3{4} = \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}},
  \quad \log_4{5} = \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}}, \quad \log_5{6} = \frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}},
  \quad \log_6{7} = \frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}}, \quad \log_7{8} = \frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}}

  \]


  Now, multiply all these terms together:


  \[

  \log_2{3} \cdot \log_3{4} \cdot \log_4{5} \cdot \log_5{6} \cdot \log_6{7} \cdot
  \log_7{8} = \frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}} \cdot \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}} \cdot \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}}
  \cdot \frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}} \cdot \frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}} \cdot \frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}}

  \]


  Notice that most terms cancel out:


  \[

  \frac{\log{3}}{\log{2}} \cdot \frac{\log{4}}{\log{3}} \cdot \frac{\log{5}}{\log{4}}
  \cdot \frac{\log{6}}{\log{5}} \cdot \frac{\log{7}}{\log{6}} \cdot \frac{\log{8}}{\log{7}}
  = \frac{\log{8}}{\log{2}}

  \]


  Now, simplify \(\frac{\log{8}}{\log{2}}\):


  \[

  \frac{\log{8}}{\log{2}} = \log_2{8}

  \]


  Since \(8 = 2^3\), we have:


  \[

  \log_2{8} = 3

  \]


  Thus, the value of the product is:


  \[

  \boxed{3}

  \]


  Final Answer: The final answer is $3$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
