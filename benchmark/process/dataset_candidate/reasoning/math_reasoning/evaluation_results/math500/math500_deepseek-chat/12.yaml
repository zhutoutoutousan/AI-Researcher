answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:


  1. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.**

  2. **Find the sum of the proper divisors of the result from step 1.**


  ---


  ### Step 1: Find the sum of the proper divisors of 284.


  First, we factorize 284:

  \[

  284 = 2^2 \times 71^1

  \]


  The sum of the divisors of a number \( N = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \dots
  \times p_k^{a_k} \) is given by:

  \[

  \text{Sum of divisors} = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{a_1}) \times (1 + p_2 +
  p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{a_2}) \times \dots \times (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \dots + p_k^{a_k})

  \]


  For \( 284 = 2^2 \times 71^1 \), the sum of the divisors is:

  \[

  \text{Sum of divisors} = (1 + 2 + 2^2) \times (1 + 71) = (1 + 2 + 4) \times (1 +
  71) = 7 \times 72 = 504

  \]


  The sum of the **proper divisors** is the sum of the divisors minus the number itself:

  \[

  \text{Sum of proper divisors of 284} = 504 - 284 = 220

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Find the sum of the proper divisors of 220.


  Now, we factorize 220:

  \[

  220 = 2^2 \times 5^1 \times 11^1

  \]


  The sum of the divisors of \( 220 = 2^2 \times 5^1 \times 11^1 \) is:

  \[

  \text{Sum of divisors} = (1 + 2 + 2^2) \times (1 + 5) \times (1 + 11) = (1 + 2 +
  4) \times (1 + 5) \times (1 + 11) = 7 \times 6 \times 12 = 504

  \]


  The sum of the **proper divisors** is the sum of the divisors minus the number itself:

  \[

  \text{Sum of proper divisors of 220} = 504 - 220 = 284

  \]

  ### Final Answer:

  The sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is \( 284
  \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\

  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
