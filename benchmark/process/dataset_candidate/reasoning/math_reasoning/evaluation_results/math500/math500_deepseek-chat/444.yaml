answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly\
  \ chosen point inside rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is closer to the center \\(O\\) than\
  \ to any of the four vertices \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), or \\(D\\).\n\n### Step\
  \ 1: Set Up Coordinates\nLet\u2019s place rectangle \\(ABCD\\) on a coordinate plane\
  \ such that:\n- \\(O\\) is at the origin \\((0, 0)\\).\n- The rectangle is symmetric\
  \ about \\(O\\), so the vertices are at:\n  - \\(A = (-a, b)\\)\n  - \\(B = (a,\
  \ b)\\)\n  - \\(C = (a, -b)\\)\n  - \\(D = (-a, -b)\\)\n\nGiven that \\(AB/AD =\
  \ k\\), we can express the side lengths in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n- \\(AB\
  \ = 2a\\)\n- \\(AD = 2b\\)\n\nThus, \\(k = \\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{2a}{2b} = \\\
  frac{a}{b}\\), so \\(a = k b\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Region Closer to \\\
  (O\\) Than to Any Vertex\nA point \\((x, y)\\) is closer to \\(O\\) than to any\
  \ vertex if the distance to \\(O\\) is less than the distance to each vertex. Mathematically,\
  \ this means:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\
  \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} <\
  \ \\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \\sqrt{(x + a)^2\
  \ + (y + b)^2}\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides of each inequality and simplifying, we\
  \ get:\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2\
  \ + (y - b)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + y^2\
  \ < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying these inequalities,\
  \ we find that the region closer to \\(O\\) than to any vertex is bounded by the\
  \ lines:\n\\[\nx = \\pm \\frac{a}{2}, \\quad y = \\pm \\frac{b}{2}\n\\]\n\n### Step\
  \ 3: Calculate the Area of the Region\nThe region closer to \\(O\\) than to any\
  \ vertex is a smaller rectangle with side lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Thus, its\
  \ area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area}_{\\text{closer}} = a \\cdot b\n\\]\n\n### Step 4:\
  \ Calculate the Area of Rectangle \\(ABCD\\)\nThe area of rectangle \\(ABCD\\) is:\n\
  \\[\n\\text{Area}_{ABCD} = 2a \\cdot 2b = 4ab\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Probability\n\
  The probability \\(P\\) that a randomly chosen point is closer to \\(O\\) than to\
  \ any vertex is the ratio of the area closer to \\(O\\) to the area of the entire\
  \ rectangle:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{\\text{Area}_{\\text{closer}}}{\\text{Area}_{ABCD}}\
  \ = \\frac{ab}{4ab} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\boxed{\\\
  dfrac{1}{4}}\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{4}}\\\
  ). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
