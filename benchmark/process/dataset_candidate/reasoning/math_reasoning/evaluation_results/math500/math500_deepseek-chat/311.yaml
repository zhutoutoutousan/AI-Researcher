answer: "To solve this problem, we can use the property that a number is congruent\
  \ modulo 9 to the sum of its digits. This is because \\(10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}\\\
  ), so each digit's place value reduces to 1 modulo 9. Therefore, we can find the\
  \ sum of the digits of each term and then sum those results.\n\nLet's break it down\
  \ step by step:\n\n1. **Sum the digits of each term:**\n   - \\(1\\): \\(1\\)\n\
  \   - \\(12\\): \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n   - \\(123\\): \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\)\n   - \\(1234\\\
  ): \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\)\n   - \\(12345\\): \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\\)\n  \
  \ - \\(123456\\): \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\\)\n   - \\(1234567\\): \\(1 + 2\
  \ + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\\)\n   - \\(12345678\\): \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7\
  \ + 8 = 36\\)\n\n2. **Sum all the results:**\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 21\
  \ + 28 + 36\n   \\]\n   Let's compute this step by step:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 = 4\n\
  \   \\]\n   \\[\n   4 + 6 = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10 + 10 = 20\n   \\]\n   \\[\n\
  \   20 + 15 = 35\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   35 + 21 = 56\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   56 + 28 =\
  \ 84\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   84 + 36 = 120\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find \\(120 \\pmod{9}\\):**\n\
  \   To find \\(120 \\pmod{9}\\), we can sum the digits of 120:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2\
  \ + 0 = 3\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(120 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{9}\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n\
  \   The value of \\(n\\) is \\(3\\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $3$. I\
  \ hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
