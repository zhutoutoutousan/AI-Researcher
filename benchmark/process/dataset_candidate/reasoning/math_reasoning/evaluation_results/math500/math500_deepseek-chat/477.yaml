answer: "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many distinct possible values\
  \ there are for the digit \\( B \\) such that the two-digit number \\( ``B6'' \\\
  ) is the square of a positive integer. \n\n1. **Understand the problem**: The number\
  \ \\( ``B6'' \\) can be expressed as \\( 10B + 6 \\), where \\( B \\) is the tens\
  \ digit. We are looking for all possible values of \\( B \\) such that \\( 10B +\
  \ 6 \\) is a perfect square.\n\n2. **Set up the equation**: Let \\( n \\) be a positive\
  \ integer such that \\( n^2 = 10B + 6 \\). Since \\( ``B6'' \\) is a two-digit number,\
  \ \\( n^2 \\) must satisfy \\( 16 \\leq n^2 \\leq 96 \\) (because \\( B \\) ranges\
  \ from 1 to 9, and the smallest two-digit number is 16 when \\( B = 1 \\), and the\
  \ largest is 96 when \\( B = 9 \\)).\n\n3. **Find the range of \\( n \\)**: We need\
  \ to find all integers \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 \\) is between 16 and 96. The\
  \ smallest integer \\( n \\) satisfying \\( n^2 \\geq 16 \\) is \\( n = 4 \\) (since\
  \ \\( 4^2 = 16 \\)), and the largest integer \\( n \\) satisfying \\( n^2 \\leq\
  \ 96 \\) is \\( n = 9 \\) (since \\( 9^2 = 81 \\) and \\( 10^2 = 100 \\), which\
  \ is too large).\n\n4. **List the squares**: The squares of the integers from 4\
  \ to 9 are:\n   - \\( 4^2 = 16 \\)\n   - \\( 5^2 = 25 \\)\n   - \\( 6^2 = 36 \\\
  )\n   - \\( 7^2 = 49 \\)\n   - \\( 8^2 = 64 \\)\n   - \\( 9^2 = 81 \\)\n\n5. **Check\
  \ which squares end with 6**: We are looking for squares that end with the digit\
  \ 6. From the list above:\n   - \\( 4^2 = 16 \\) ends with 6.\n   - \\( 6^2 = 36\
  \ \\) ends with 6.\n   - \\( 8^2 = 64 \\) does not end with 6.\n   - \\( 9^2 = 81\
  \ \\) does not end with 6.\n\n   So, the relevant squares are 16 and 36.\n\n6. **Determine\
  \ \\( B \\) for each valid square**:\n   - For \\( n^2 = 16 \\), we have \\( 10B\
  \ + 6 = 16 \\). Solving for \\( B \\), we get \\( B = 1 \\).\n   - For \\( n^2 =\
  \ 36 \\), we have \\( 10B + 6 = 36 \\). Solving for \\( B \\), we get \\( B = 3\
  \ \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The possible values for \\( B \\) are 1 and 3. Therefore,\
  \ there are 2 distinct possible values for \\( B \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final\
  \ answer is $2$. I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\

  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\

  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
