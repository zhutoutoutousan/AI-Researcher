answer: 'To find the minimum value of the expression:


  \[

  \frac{(a + b + c)\left[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2\right]}{abc},

  \]


  we can proceed with the following steps:


  ---


  ### Step 1: Simplify the expression

  Let \( S = a + b + c \). The expression becomes:


  \[

  \frac{S \left[(a + b)^2 + (a + b + 4c)^2\right]}{abc}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 2: Introduce substitutions

  Let \( x = a + b \) and \( y = c \). Then \( S = x + y \), and the expression simplifies
  to:


  \[

  \frac{(x + y)\left[x^2 + (x + 4y)^2\right]}{ab \cdot y}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 3: Apply the AM-GM inequality

  By the AM-GM inequality, \( a + b \geq 2\sqrt{ab} \), so \( x \geq 2\sqrt{ab} \).
  This implies:


  \[

  ab \leq \frac{x^2}{4}.

  \]


  Substituting this into the expression, we get:


  \[

  \frac{(x + y)\left[x^2 + (x + 4y)^2\right]}{\frac{x^2}{4} \cdot y} = \frac{4(x +
  y)\left[x^2 + (x + 4y)^2\right]}{x^2 y}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 4: Simplify further

  Expand \( (x + 4y)^2 \):


  \[

  (x + 4y)^2 = x^2 + 8xy + 16y^2.

  \]


  Substitute this back into the expression:


  \[

  \frac{4(x + y)\left[x^2 + x^2 + 8xy + 16y^2\right]}{x^2 y} = \frac{4(x + y)(2x^2
  + 8xy + 16y^2)}{x^2 y}.

  \]


  Factor out \( 2 \) from the numerator:


  \[

  \frac{8(x + y)(x^2 + 4xy + 8y^2)}{x^2 y}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 5: Introduce a ratio

  Let \( t = \frac{x}{y} \). Then \( x = ty \), and the expression becomes:


  \[

  \frac{8(ty + y)(t^2 y^2 + 4ty \cdot y + 8y^2)}{t^2 y^2 \cdot y} = \frac{8y(t + 1)(t^2
  y^2 + 4ty^2 + 8y^2)}{t^2 y^3}.

  \]


  Simplify:


  \[

  \frac{8(t + 1)(t^2 + 4t + 8)}{t^2}.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 6: Minimize the expression

  We now minimize the function:


  \[

  f(t) = \frac{8(t + 1)(t^2 + 4t + 8)}{t^2}.

  \]


  Expand the numerator:


  \[

  f(t) = \frac{8(t^3 + 5t^2 + 12t + 8)}{t^2} = 8t + 40 + \frac{96}{t} + \frac{64}{t^2}.

  \]


  To find the minimum, take the derivative of \( f(t) \) with respect to \( t \) and
  set it to zero:


  \[

  f''(t) = 8 - \frac{96}{t^2} - \frac{128}{t^3}.

  \]


  Set \( f''(t) = 0 \):


  \[

  8 - \frac{96}{t^2} - \frac{128}{t^3} = 0.

  \]


  Multiply through by \( t^3 \):


  \[

  8t^3 - 96t - 128 = 0.

  \]


  Divide by 8:


  \[

  t^3 - 12t - 16 = 0.

  \]


  Solve for \( t \). Testing \( t = 4 \):


  \[

  4^3 - 12(4) - 16 = 64 - 48 - 16 = 0.

  \]


  Thus, \( t = 4 \) is a critical point. Substituting \( t = 4 \) into \( f(t) \):


  \[

  f(4) = 8(4) + 40 + \frac{96}{4} + \frac{64}{16} = 32 + 40 + 24 + 4 = 100.

  \]


  ---


  ### Step 7: Verify the minimum

  The second derivative test confirms that this is indeed a minimum. Therefore, the
  minimum value of the expression is \( 100 \).

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
