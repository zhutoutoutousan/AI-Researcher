answer: "To solve the problem, we need to find positive integers \\( a \\), \\( b\
  \ \\), and \\( 2009 \\) such that they form a geometric sequence with an integer\
  \ ratio \\( r \\), and \\( a < b < 2009 \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometric\
  \ sequence\nIn a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous\
  \ term by a common ratio \\( r \\). Therefore, we can write:\n\\[\nb = a \\cdot\
  \ r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2009 = b \\cdot r = a \\cdot r^2.\n\\]\nThis means\
  \ \\( 2009 = a \\cdot r^2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Factorize 2009\nWe factorize \\( 2009\
  \ \\) to find possible values of \\( r \\) and \\( a \\):\n\\[\n2009 = 7 \\times\
  \ 7 \\times 41 = 7^2 \\times 41.\n\\]\nThe factors of \\( 2009 \\) are \\( 1, 7,\
  \ 41, 49, 287, 2009 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find possible values of \\( r \\)\nSince\
  \ \\( r \\) is an integer ratio and \\( a < b < 2009 \\), \\( r \\) must be a factor\
  \ of \\( 2009 \\) greater than 1. The possible values of \\( r \\) are \\( 7, 41,\
  \ 49, 287 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Test possible values of \\( r \\)\n1. If \\( r = 7\
  \ \\), then:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{2009}{r^2} = \\frac{2009}{49} = 41.\n   \\]\n\
  \   This gives \\( b = a \\cdot r = 41 \\cdot 7 = 287 \\), and \\( 2009 = 287 \\\
  cdot 7 \\). This satisfies \\( a < b < 2009 \\).\n\n2. If \\( r = 41 \\), then:\n\
  \   \\[\n   a = \\frac{2009}{r^2} = \\frac{2009}{1681} \\approx 1.195,\n   \\]\n\
  \   which is not an integer. So, \\( r = 41 \\) is invalid.\n\n3. If \\( r = 49\
  \ \\), then:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{2009}{r^2} = \\frac{2009}{2401} \\approx 0.837,\n\
  \   \\]\n   which is not an integer. So, \\( r = 49 \\) is invalid.\n\n4. If \\\
  ( r = 287 \\), then:\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{2009}{r^2} = \\frac{2009}{82369} \\\
  approx 0.024,\n   \\]\n   which is not an integer. So, \\( r = 287 \\) is invalid.\n\
  \n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe only valid value of \\( r \\) is \\( 7 \\), which\
  \ gives \\( a = 41 \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\(41\\). I hope it\
  \ is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
