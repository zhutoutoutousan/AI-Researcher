answer: 'To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange
  6 different books on a shelf such that the 2 math books are not next to each other.


  ### Step 1: Total number of arrangements without restrictions

  First, calculate the total number of ways to arrange all 6 books without any restrictions.
  Since all 6 books are different, the total number of arrangements is:

  \[

  6! = 720

  \]


  ### Step 2: Number of arrangements where the math books are next to each other

  Now, calculate the number of arrangements where the 2 math books are next to each
  other. Treat the 2 math books as a single "super book." This means we now have 5
  "items" to arrange: the "super book" and the 4 other books.


  The number of ways to arrange these 5 items is:

  \[

  5! = 120

  \]


  However, the 2 math books within the "super book" can be arranged in 2 different
  ways (e.g., Math Book A first and Math Book B second, or vice versa). Therefore,
  the total number of arrangements where the math books are next to each other is:

  \[

  5! \times 2 = 120 \times 2 = 240

  \]


  ### Step 3: Subtract the restricted arrangements from the total

  To find the number of arrangements where the math books are not next to each other,
  subtract the number of restricted arrangements from the total number of arrangements:

  \[

  6! - (5! \times 2) = 720 - 240 = 480

  \]


  ### Final Answer

  The number of ways to arrange the 6 books such that the 2 math books are not next
  to each other is 480.


  Final Answer: The final answer is $480$. I hope it is correct.'

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
  \ answer the following math question. You should think step by step to solve it.\n\
  \nProblem:\nSuppose that I have $6$ different books, $2$ of which are math books.\
  \ In how many ways can I stack my $6$ books on a shelf if I do not want the math\
  \ books to be next to each other?\n\nPlease given your final answer (answer ONLY)\
  \ within the format of `Final Answer: The final answer is <answer>. I hope it is\
