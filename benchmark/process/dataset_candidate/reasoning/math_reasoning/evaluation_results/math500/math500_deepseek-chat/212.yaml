answer: "Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let\
  \ \\( c \\) be the number of questions Frank answered correctly.\n   - Let \\( w\
  \ \\) be the number of questions Frank answered incorrectly.\n   - Frank answered\
  \ a total of 80 questions, so:\n     \\[\n     c + w = 80\n     \\]\n\n2. **Set\
  \ Up the Scoring Equation:**\n   - Each correct answer gives 5 points, and each\
  \ incorrect answer gives -2 points. Frank's total score is 232 points, so:\n   \
  \  \\[\n     5c - 2w = 232\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the System of Equations:**\n\
  \   - From the first equation, solve for \\( w \\):\n     \\[\n     w = 80 - c\n\
  \     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( w = 80 - c \\) into the second equation:\n     \\\
  [\n     5c - 2(80 - c) = 232\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n\
  \     5c - 160 + 2c = 232\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     7c - 160 = 232\n     \\]\n \
  \    \\[\n     7c = 232 + 160\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     7c = 392\n     \\]\n   \
  \  \\[\n     c = \\frac{392}{7}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     c = 56\n     \\]\n\n4.\
  \ **Conclusion:**\n   - Frank answered 56 questions correctly.\n\nFinal Answer:\
  \ The final answer is \\(56\\). I hope it is correct."

prompt: "Problem:\nFind the domain of the expression  $\\frac{\\sqrt{x-2}}{\\sqrt{5-x}}$.}\n\
  \nSolution:\nThe expressions inside each square root must be non-negative. Therefore,\
  \ $x-2 \\ge 0$, so $x\\ge2$, and $5 - x \\ge 0$, so $x \\le 5$. Also, the denominator\
  \ cannot be equal to zero, so $5-x>0$, which gives $x<5$. Therefore, the domain\
  \ of the expression is $\\boxed{[2,5)}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $[2,5)$.\
  \ I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B}\
  \ = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$\n\nSolution:\nWe have that\
  \ $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}) = (\\det \\mathbf{A})(\\det \\mathbf{B}) = (2)(12)\
  \ = \\boxed{24}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $24$. I hope it is correct.\n\
  \nProblem:\nTerrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two\
  \ 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift\
  \ the same total weight?\n\nSolution:\nIf Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12\
  \ times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts\
  \ two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\\
  cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$:\n\
  \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $16$. I hope it is correct.\n\nProblem:\nIf the\
  \ system of equations\n\n\\begin{align*}\n6x-4y&=a,\\\n6y-9x &=b.\n\\end{align*}has\
  \ a solution $(x, y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are both nonzero,\nfind $\\frac{a}{b},$\
  \ assuming $b$ is nonzero.\n\nSolution:\nIf we multiply the first equation by $-\\\
  frac{3}{2}$, we obtain\n\n$$6y-9x=-\\frac{3}{2}a.$$Since we also know that $6y-9x=b$,\
  \ we have\n\n$$-\\frac{3}{2}a=b\\Rightarrow\\frac{a}{b}=\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}.$$\n\
  Final Answer: The final answer is $-\\frac{2}{3}$. I hope it is correct.\n\nPlease\
