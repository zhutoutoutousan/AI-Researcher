    "abstract": "Recent studies show that graph neural networks (GNNs) are prevalent to model\nhigh-order relationships for collaborative filtering (CF). Towards this\nresearch line, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has exhibited powerful\nperformance in addressing the supervision label shortage issue by learning\naugmented user and item representations. While many of them show their\neffectiveness, two key questions still remain unexplored: i) Most existing\nGCL-based CF models are still limited by ignoring the fact that user-item\ninteraction behaviors are often driven by diverse latent intent factors (e.g.,\nshopping for family party, preferred color or brand of products); ii) Their\nintroduced non-adaptive augmentation techniques are vulnerable to noisy\ninformation, which raises concerns about the model's robustness and the risk of\nincorporating misleading self-supervised signals. In light of these\nlimitations, we propose a Disentangled Contrastive Collaborative Filtering\nframework (DCCF) to realize intent disentanglement with self-supervised\naugmentation in an adaptive fashion. With the learned disentangled\nrepresentations with global context, our DCCF is able to not only distill\nfiner-grained latent factors from the entangled self-supervision signals but\nalso alleviate the augmentation-induced noise. Finally, the cross-view\ncontrastive learning task is introduced to enable adaptive augmentation with\nour parameterized interaction mask generator. Experiments on various public\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing\nsolutions. Our model implementation is released at the link\nhttps://github.com/HKUDS/DCCF.",

    "task2": "1. The primary task or problem domain the research tackles is the enhancement of collaborative filtering in recommender systems through the integration of disentangled contrastive learning, which aims to capture and utilize diverse latent intent factors driving user-item interactions.\n\n2. Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work include the inability of many GCL-based collaborative filtering models to effectively disentangle the diverse latent intents behind user-item interactions, as well as their vulnerability to noise and suboptimal self-supervised signals due to non-adaptive augmentation techniques.\n\n3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome involve the need to develop a method that can accurately generate disentangled contrastive signals for informative augmentation while being robust against noisy data, thereby improving the proposed model's ability to capture genuine user preferences.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions include the development of a framework that enables intent disentanglement and adaptive self-supervised augmentation, leading to enhanced robustness and generalization in recommendation performance. This study also seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of user-item interactions by distilling finer-grained latent factors and improving the overall effectiveness of collaborative filtering models."
