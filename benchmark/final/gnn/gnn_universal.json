    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are currently highly regarded in graph representation learning tasks due to their significant performance. Although various propagation mechanisms and graph filters were proposed, few works have considered the convergence and stability of graph filters under infinite-depth scenarios. To address this problem, we elucidate the criterion for the graph filter formed by power series and further establish a scalable regularized learning principle, which can guide us on how to design infinite deep GNN. Following the framework, we develop Adaptive Power GNN (APGNN), a deep GNN that employs exponentially decaying weights to aggregate graph information of different orders so as to mine the deeper neighbor information. Different from existing GNNs, APGNN can be seamlessly extended to an infinite-depth network. Moreover, we analyze the generalization of the proposed learning framework via uniform convergence and present its upper bound in theory. Experimental results show that APGNN obtains superior performance against the state-of-the-art GNNs.",

    "task1": "The proposed model described in this paper is intended for node classification tasks within graph representation learning. To implement the core methodology, researchers should follow these detailed steps:\n\n1. **Task Objective**: The main task of the proposed model is node classification on graph-structured data.\n\n2. **Core Techniques**:\n   - **Type of Model**: Utilize a graph neural network (GNN) that operates on the principle of adaptive power series graph filters.\n   - **Optimization Method**: Regularize the learning of coefficients that form the graph filter to ensure convergence and stability through Lipschitz continuity.\n   - **Data Processing**: Construct a normalized adjacency matrix and feature representation of graph nodes to feed into the proposed model.\n\n3. **Technical Components**:\n   - **Graph Filter Design**: Use a learnable graph filter specified as \\(g_{K,P}(L) = \\sum_{k=0}^{K} \\beta_k \\alpha^k \\tilde{A}^{kP}\\) where \\(|\\beta_k| \\leq 1\\) and \\(0 < \\alpha < 1\\). The decay rate \\(\\alpha\\), defined to ensure convergence, acts on the polynomial coefficients to emphasize lower-order neighbors.\n   - **Feature Extraction Mechanism**: Employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a feature extractor, which processes the input node features.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**:\n   - **Key Parameters**: \n     - **K**: The order of the polynomial graph filter (typically set to 10 based on experimental findings).\n     - **P**: The order of the P-hop filter (tune from 1 upwards to balance performance and stability).\n     - **\\(\\alpha\\)**: Tune this hyperparameter to be between 0.1 and 0.9, aiming for the optimal range typically around 0.7.\n   - **Input/Output Specifications**: \n     - **Input**: Node features represented as a matrix \\([X]\\) where each row corresponds to a node and columns refer to features.\n     - **Output**: A matrix \\(Z\\) with the node representation predicting their classes.\n   - **Constraints**: Ensure the coefficients' norm satisfies \\(\\| \\beta \\|_1 \\leq M\\), enforcing convergence conditions on the graph filter.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Interaction**:\n   - Begin by constructing the normalized adjacency matrix \\(\\tilde{A}\\) using the degree matrix and adjacency matrix of the graph.\n   - Implement the graph filter based on the power series expansion with the defined polynomial functions.\n   - Pass the graph features through the MLP to generate node embeddings, which are then processed through the graph filter.\n   - Aggregate the results using the defined decay terms to focus more on lower-order neighbors, combining outputs into the final node representations.\n   - Train the proposed model end-to-end with respect to fitting the classification labels, tuning the parameters \\(K\\), \\(P\\), and \\(\\alpha\\) as necessary based on validation performance.\n\n6. **Critical Implementation Details**:\n   - **Convergence and Stability**: Regularly validate convergence by ensuring \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |\\beta_k| \\leq M\\) is controlled during training to mitigate over-smoothing issues, particularly when using high \\(P\\) values.\n   - **Performance Tuning**: Conduct a grid search or similar to ascertain optimal settings for the polynomial order \\(K\\) and decay rate \\(\\alpha\\), as small deviations can significantly impact the stability and accuracy of the proposed model.\n\nImplement these steps with attention to hyperparameter tuning and structural considerations to replicate the methodology effectively as prescribed in this study.",
    "task2": "1. The primary task or problem domain the research tackles is the design of graph neural networks (GNNs) with a focus on achieving convergence and stability, particularly under scenarios involving infinite depth.\n\n2. Current limitations in existing approaches that motivated this work include the inability of various graph filters to guarantee convergence as the network depth approaches infinity and the lack of a general principle for constructing such filters in GNNs.\n\n3. Core challenges the researchers aim to overcome include ensuring that the proposed graph filters maintain stability and convergence when employed in infinitely deep GNN architectures, as well as devising a robust framework that can effectively guide the design of these filters.\n\n4. Key objectives and intended contributions consist of proposing a universal learning principle that provides theoretical guidance for constructing deep GNNs; presenting a new GNN framework capable of adaptive filtering that accounts for the varying importance of neighbor information; and conducting a generalization analysis that reinforces the theoretical foundations of the proposed model."
