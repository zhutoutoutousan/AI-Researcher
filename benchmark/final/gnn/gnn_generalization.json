    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs), as the de-facto model class for representation learning on graphs, are built upon the multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) architecture with additional message passing layers to allow features to flow across nodes. While conventional wisdom commonly attributes the success of GNNs to their advanced expressivity, we conjecture that this is not the main cause of GNNs' superiority in node-level prediction tasks. This paper pinpoints the major source of GNNs' performance gain to their intrinsic generalization capability, by introducing an intermediate model class dubbed as P(ropagational)MLP, which is identical to standard MLP in training, but then adopts GNN's architecture in testing. Intriguingly, we observe that PMLPs consistently perform on par with (or even exceed) their GNN counterparts, while being much more efficient in training. This finding sheds new insights into understanding the learning behavior of GNNs, and can be used as an analytic tool for dissecting various GNN-related research problems. As an initial step to analyze the inherent generalizability of GNNs, we show the essential difference between MLP and PMLP at infinite-width limit lies in the NTK feature map in the post-training stage. Moreover, by examining their extrapolation behavior, we find that though many GNNs and their PMLP counterparts cannot extrapolate non-linear functions for extremely out-of-distribution samples, they have greater potential to generalize to testing samples near the training data range as natural advantages of GNN architectures.",

Implement MP operations before passing the result to FF layers during testing. \n   - **Step 4**: Combine the outputs of the final layer with a linear classifier (or softmax) for predictions.\n\n6. **Critical Implementation Details**:\n   - Ensure efficient batching during training for scalability, especially for larger datasets.\n   - Validate your implementation on multiple benchmark datasets to ensure robustness.\n   - Monitor for overfitting, especially noting the performance drop in deeper models (beyond 2 layers may require residual connections to mitigate over-smoothing).\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to replicate the core methodology discussed in this paper effectively.",
    "task2": "The primary task the research tackles is understanding the generalization capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in comparison to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), specifically in node-level prediction tasks within graph structures.\n\nExisting approaches have primarily focused on analyzing the representational power of GNNs, while their generalization capabilities\u2014particularly in relation to traditional neural networks like MLPs\u2014remain underexplored. This gap highlights the need for deeper insights into why GNNs exhibit superior performance and how their architectural features contribute to generalization.\n\nThe core challenges the researchers aim to overcome include elucidating the underlying reasons for GNNs' superior generalization, identifying the key architectural differences that facilitate better performance, and addressing the limitations of MLPs when applied to graph data.\n\nThe key objectives and intended contributions of this study are to bridge the understanding between GNNs and MLPs by introducing an intermediate model class that combines aspects of both architectures, thereby revealing the intrinsic generalization capabilities of the proposed model. The work aims to not only derive theoretical insights but also provide practical implications for model design, ultimately contributing to more efficient and robust graph representation learning."
