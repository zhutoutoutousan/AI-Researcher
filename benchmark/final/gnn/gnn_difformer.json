    "abstract": "Real-world data generation often involves complex inter-dependencies among instances, violating the IID-data hypothesis of standard learning paradigms and posing a challenge for uncovering the geometric structures for learning desired instance representations. To this end, we introduce an energy constrained diffusion model which encodes a batch of instances from a dataset into evolutionary states that progressively incorporate other instances' information by their interactions. The diffusion process is constrained by descent criteria w.r.t.~a principled energy function that characterizes the global consistency of instance representations over latent structures. We provide rigorous theory that implies closed-form optimal estimates for the pairwise diffusion strength among arbitrary instance pairs, which gives rise to a new class of neural encoders, dubbed as DIFFormer (diffusion-based Transformers), with two instantiations: a simple version with linear complexity for prohibitive instance numbers, and an advanced version for learning complex structures. Experiments highlight the wide applicability of our model as a general-purpose encoder backbone with superior performance in various tasks, such as node classification on large graphs, semi-supervised image/text classification, and spatial-temporal dynamics prediction.",

    "task1": "The proposed approach works on the task of uncovering data dependencies and learning instance representations from datasets that may not have complete or reliable relationships, particularly in semi-supervised contexts like node classification, image/text classification, and spatial-temporal dynamics prediction.\n\nThe core techniques/algorithms used in this paper include an energy-constrained diffusion model represented as a partial differential equation (PDE), an explicit Euler scheme for numerical solutions, and a form of adaptive diffusivity function based on the energy function. The proposed architecture utilizes a diffusion-based Transformer framework that allows for all-pair feature propagation among instances.\n\nThe major technical components serve the following purposes:\n   - **Diffusion Process:** Encodes instances into evolving states by modeling information flow, where instance representations evolve according to a PDE illuminating the relationships among the instances.\n   - **Energy Function:** Provides constraints to regularize the diffusion process and guide the proposed model towards desired low-energy embeddings, enhancing the quality of representations.\n   - **Diffusivity Function:** Specifies the strength of information flow between instances, adapting based on the instance states, and allows for flexible and efficient propagation strategies.\n\nImplementation details for each component:\n   - **Diffusion Process Input:** Requires a batch of instances represented as a matrix of size \\(N \\times D\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of instances and \\(D\\) is the input feature dimension.  \n   - **Diffusion Process Output:** Produces the updated instance representations after \\(K\\) propagation steps. The step size \\(\\tau\\) should be set within the range (0, 1).\n   - **Energy Function:** Implemented as \\(E(Z, k; \\delta) = ||Z - Z^{(k)}||^2_F + \\lambda \\sum_{i,j} \\delta(||z_i - z_j||^2_2)\\), with \\(\\delta\\) being a non-decreasing, concave function.\n   - **Key Parameters:** \n     - Step size \\(\\tau\\)\n     - Layer number \\(K\\) (number of diffusion propagation steps)\n     - Regularization weight \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nStep-by-step description of interactions:\n   - Start by initializing the instance representations.\n   - For each layer of diffusion, compute the diffusivity \\(S(k)\\) based on current embeddings through a function \\(f\\) which can be defined differently depending on the proposed model implementation.\n   - Update the instance representations using the defined diffusion equations, ensuring to conserve states and introduce propagation according to the computed diffusivity.\n   - After \\(K\\) layers of diffusion, apply a final output layer to produce logits for predictions.\n\nCritical implementation details that affect performance:\n   - The choice of diffusivity function \\(f\\) greatly impacts the proposed model's capacity to learn complex dependencies, where specific formulations (like linear or logistic) yield different abilities in capturing inter-instance relationships.\n   - Ensure that the values of \\(\\tau\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) are set appropriately to balance convergence speed and representation quality; using a smaller \\(\\tau\\) may require deeper layers to learn effectively.\n   - Optimization parameters like learning rate and early stopping criteria are essential, particularly for large-scale datasets where convergence behavior can vary widely depending on architecture size and complexity. \n\nThese details establish a necessary framework for implementing the proposed methodology in practice based on the provided research insights.",
    "task2": "The primary task the research tackles is learning effective representations for real-world data instances that often exhibit complex inter-dependencies and structures, which cannot be adequately modeled under traditional IID assumptions of standard learning paradigms.\n\nCurrent limitations in existing approaches include the difficulty of encoding potential interactions between instance pairs due to the need for sufficient degrees of freedom, which can complicate the learning process, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Furthermore, typical methods struggle with scalability in large datasets due to their computational complexity.\n\nThe core challenges the researchers aim to overcome include addressing the inconsistency between observed relational structures and the underlying data geometry, which can lead to systematic biases in representation learning. Additionally, they seek to build a methodology flexible enough to efficiently learn from large and possibly noisy datasets while ensuring that the inter-dependencies among instances are effectively captured.\n\nKey objectives and intended contributions of this study involve introducing a novel general-purpose encoder framework that leverages a geometric diffusion model to uncover data dependencies through a principled energy minimization process. The contributions also include providing theoretical insights that create a unifying perspective on existing models, alongside practical instantiations that maintain scalability and flexibility for various applications in node classification and other tasks."
