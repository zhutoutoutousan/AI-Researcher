    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have evolved to understand graph structures\nthrough recursive exchanges and aggregations among nodes. To enhance\nrobustness, self-supervised learning (SSL) has become a vital tool for data\naugmentation. Traditional methods often depend on fine-tuning with\ntask-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness when labeled data is scarce.\nOur research tackles this by advancing graph model generalization in zero-shot\nlearning environments. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs),\nwe aim to create a graph-oriented LLM capable of exceptional generalization\nacross various datasets and tasks without relying on downstream graph data. We\nintroduce the GraphGPT framework, which integrates LLMs with graph structural\nknowledge through graph instruction tuning. This framework includes a\ntext-graph grounding component to link textual and graph structures and a\ndual-stage instruction tuning approach with a lightweight graph-text alignment\nprojector. These innovations allow LLMs to comprehend complex graph structures\nand enhance adaptability across diverse datasets and tasks. Our framework\ndemonstrates superior generalization in both supervised and zero-shot graph\nlearning tasks, surpassing existing benchmarks. The open-sourced model\nimplementation of our GraphGPT is available at\nhttps://github.com/HKUDS/GraphGPT.",

Key parameters include the number of layers (l), learning rate (e.g., 2e-3), and activation function (e.g., ReLU). Input is the adjacency matrix (A) and feature matrix (X); output is the encoded graph representation.\n   - **Text Encoder**: Use a transformer model, ensuring the input consists of the text associated with each graph node. Normalize the output representations.\n   - **Alignment Projector**: Implement a linear layer to project graph representations to align with text representations. Output should match the number of graph tokens.\n   - **Instruction Tuning**: \n     - Self-supervised stage: Use unlabeled graph structures to create instructions for the LLM. Generate prompts that include graph tokens and human questions.\n     - Task-specific stage: Fine-tune the LLM with labeled data, modifying the parameters of the alignment projector while keeping other components fixed.\n   - **CoT Distillation**: Generate reasoning prompts using a powerful LLM and refine the reasoning capabilities of your model.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Interaction**:\n   - Start by encoding the graph using the GNN encoder. Pass the graph's adjacency and feature matrices.\n   - Simultaneously encode the node-associated text using the text encoder.\n   - Normalize and align the outputs of both encoders using the lightweight alignment projector.\n   - In the self-supervised instruction tuning stage, generate graph matching tasks to inform the LLM using unlabeled data.\n   - Proceed to the task-specific instruction tuning, where you provide labeled examples to adapt the LLM's reasoning for specific graph tasks.\n   - Incorporate CoT techniques to enhance the proposed model's reasoning abilities by distilling knowledge from a larger pre-trained model.\n\n6. **Critical Implementation Details**:\n   - Ensure that the parameters of the GNN and text encoder are properly initialized and that their representations are appropriately normalized.\n   - The batch sizes during training should be managed to avoid memory overflow, especially when tuning the LLM parameters.\n   - Monitor the learning rates and warmup ratios to stabilize the training process, particularly for the alignment projector.\n   - During evaluation, assess both the accuracy and generalization ability of the proposed model across different graph datasets and tasks to ensure robustness.\n\nBy following these instructions, researchers can effectively reproduce the core methodology of the proposed framework in this study without requiring further reading.",
