    "abstract": "Graph transformers have emerged as a promising architecture for a variety of\ngraph learning and representation tasks. Despite their successes, though, it\nremains challenging to scale graph transformers to large graphs while\nmaintaining accuracy competitive with message-passing networks. In this paper,\nwe introduce Exphormer, a framework for building powerful and scalable graph\ntransformers. Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two\nmechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical\ncharacteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity,\nyield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph,\nwhile allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting\ntransformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the\nrecently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical\nresults on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results\non three datasets. We also show that Exphormer can scale to datasets on larger\ngraphs than shown in previous graph transformer architectures. Code can be\nfound at \\url{https://github.com/hamed1375/Exphormer}.",
