    "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown great promise for image and video generation, but\nsampling from state-of-the-art models requires expensive numerical integration\nof a generative ODE. One approach for tackling this problem is rectified flows,\nwhich iteratively learn smooth ODE paths that are less susceptible to\ntruncation error. However, rectified flows still require a relatively large\nnumber of function evaluations (NFEs). In this work, we propose improved\ntechniques for training rectified flows, allowing them to compete with\n\\emph{knowledge distillation} methods even in the low NFE setting. Our main\ninsight is that under realistic settings, a single iteration of the Reflow\nalgorithm for training rectified flows is sufficient to learn nearly straight\ntrajectories; hence, the current practice of using multiple Reflow iterations\nis unnecessary. We thus propose techniques to improve one-round training of\nrectified flows, including a U-shaped timestep distribution and LPIPS-Huber\npremetric. With these techniques, we improve the FID of the previous\n2-rectified flow by up to 75\\% in the 1 NFE setting on CIFAR-10. On ImageNet\n64$\\times$64, our improved rectified flow outperforms the state-of-the-art\ndistillation methods such as consistency distillation and progressive\ndistillation in both one-step and two-step settings and rivals the performance\nof improved consistency training (iCT) in FID.
