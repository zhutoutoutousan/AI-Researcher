\begin{equation}
[Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}
where [Detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

\subsection{Implementation Details}
\subsubsection{[Aspect 1]}
[Description of the first technical aspect related to implementation. Include any algorithm or strategy.]

\subsubsection{[Aspect 2]}
[Description of the second technical aspect related to implementation. Include any algorithm or strategy.]

\subsection{Training Objectives}
Denote the positions of [variables related to training] as [notation]. The objective for [training mechanism 1] can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
L_{[Training Mechanism 1]} = [Mathematical representation of the objective]
\end{equation}
Similarly, for [training mechanism 2], it can be denoted as:
\begin{equation}
L_{[Training Mechanism 2]} = [Mathematical representation of the objective]
\end{equation}
The objective of [combined training method] is given by:
