\section{Optimization of [Model/Method Name]}

Our objective is to minimize [objective function], over the parameters of [parameters involved], where [explain any relevant terms]. Instead of [previous method/approach], we [describe the approach taken], effectively [describe the intended outcome]. The actual [related outcome] achieved by [existing technique] are [brief evaluation], and thus we define the objective functional as follows:

\begin{equation}
L [ g_{a}, g_{s}, P_{q} ] = [mathematical formulation of the functional]
\end{equation}

where [briefly explain any important terms used]. Given [assumptions made], we can express [related statement]. That is,

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{i} = q_{i} = [mathematical statement]
\end{equation}

where [explain indices or variables involved]. The [related distribution] is then given by [equation describing the distribution]:

\begin{equation}
P_{q_{i}}(n) = [mathematical representation]
\end{equation}

Note that [important insight about the terms or methods], rendering [method] ineffective. To allow optimization via [optimization technique], we [describe modified approach].

This relaxed formulation has [describe desirable properties]. First, [property description]. This implies that [mathematical insight]. Second, [another important property] and is [justification for property]. We examine [specific analysis or insight] in section [next section number].

We assume [assumption about distribution/marginals] for [variables], and model [describe how marginals are modeled]. Specifically, we [details on methodology]. Since [explain reasoning leading to a conclusion], [further explanation of model errors].

Given this [type of approximation], the loss function for parameters [parameters involved] can be written as:

\begin{equation}
L ( \theta , \phi ) = [mathematical representation of the loss function]
\end{equation}

where [explain terms in the equation]. This is [justification for the mathematical form], and thus [reason why it's suitable for optimization].

\subsection{Relationship to [Related Concept/Model]}

We derived our formulation directly from [related problem or context]. However, once the transition to [type of function] is made, the optimization problem resembles [describe similarity to another problem]. In [specific context/ method], we are given [data/parameters] along with a [type of model]. We seek to find [objective], which [explain complication]. The approach followed by [citation] consists of [describe method briefly]:

\begin{equation}
D_{KL}^{[q \| p]} = [mathematical expression]
\end{equation}

This objective function is equivalent to [previously mentioned function], if [conditions are satisfied]:

\begin{equation}
p_{x | \tilde{y}}(x | \tilde{y}; \lambda, \theta) = [mathematical definition]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
p_{\tilde{y}}(\tilde{y}; [parameters]) = [mathematical representation]
\end{equation}

and the approximate posterior as follows:

\begin{equation}
q(\tilde{y} | x; \phi) = [mathematical representation]
\end{equation}

where [explain meaning of components]. With this, [explanation of resulting implications]. Note that if [mention any additional conditions required], then [explain the outcome and significance].

Despite the similarity between [two frameworks or approaches], there are several [key differences]. First, [describe the first difference]. [Further details on the implications of this difference]. 

Second, [describe the second difference]. [Explain how this difference alters implications]. 

Finally, [describe any last key difference], considering [underscore the significance of this in the context of the discussion]. 

We assess the quality of [related topic] empirically in [where results or comparisons will be discussed].
