\section{[Section Title]}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Component 1: Brief description]
    \item [Component 2: Brief description]
    \item [Component 3: Brief description]
\end{enumerate}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

\subsection{[Subsection Title]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

[A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]

The representation of [variable] is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical expression or procedure]
\end{equation}

The [term] reflects [brief explanation of what this term represents].

\subsection{[Learning Methodology Title]}

To address [specific aspect], we employ [method]. Although [describe any challenges or limitations], we approximate the gradient [describe approximation method]. 

During [specific pass], [key operation or computation] as shown in equation [number]. 

Specifically, the overall loss function is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    L = [Loss function components]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of each term]. 

The components [list of components] will be optimized by [specify optimization strategy].

\subsection{[Prior Distribution Title]}

We define the prior distribution over [variables] as [categorical or another type]. [Explain any additional modifications or dependencies]. 

[Explain future work or research directions related to this section.]

[Optionally include a figure or diagram reference as needed, e.g., Figure 1: [Brief description of the figure or diagram].]
