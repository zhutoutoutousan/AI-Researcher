\section{Improving [System/Architecture Name]}

In this section, we present our improvements for the [system/architecture name]. These improvements are modular and can be utilized individually or in combination to enhance any existing model. Although the following strategies are implemented as extensions to [specific model type], many of them are also applicable to their counterparts in other domains.

\subsection{Architecture \& Scale}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. Starting with the seminal works [citation], which demonstrated [key finding], the [previous architecture] has been the dominant architecture for [specific task]. However, with the development of [related advancements], the underlying architecture has consistently evolved: from [description of early changes] to [description of current state].

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

Specifically, we propose to [desired approach]. In particular, we [explain key changes and their rationale]. These changes result in a model size of [model size], as shown in Table~\ref{table:comparison}.

\subsection{[Next Improvement Topic]}

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. A notorious shortcoming of [prior models] is [describe challenge]. We visualize such effects in Figure~\ref{figure:example}. 

We propose to condition the model on [describe resolution/parameters], which is readily accessible during training. In particular, we provide [explain conditioning parameter] as an additional input to the model. Each component is independently embedded using [explain technique], and these encodings are concatenated into a single vector that is fed into the model.

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]

\subsection{[Next Improvement Topic]}

We argue that [statement about current practices]. Motivated by this, we [describe your approach]. In practice, [detail the practical implementation]. 

We quantitatively assess the effects of [describe conditioning technique] by [briefly outline evaluation strategy]. Table~\ref{table:results} summarizes the results and verifies that [summarize findings].

\subsection{[Next Improvement Topic]}

[Describe another improvement or feature]. We [explain the methods used and their benefits]. To this end, we utilize [describe process or algorithm]. 

[Detailed explanation of key findings and metrics]. The performance metrics are summarized in Table~\ref{table:performance}.

\subsection{Putting Everything Together}

We integrate all improvements in a [describe overall model or system]. We train [model name] through a [describe training strategy]. We find that [mention any observation or conclusion from training].

Empirically, [describe findings related to outputs]. To assess the performance of our [model/system name], we conduct [description of the evaluation method].

The results demonstrate that [summarize key results]. However, when evaluating using [mention classical performance metrics], we observe that [explain disparity in results].
