\subsection{Introduction}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].

\subsection{Methodology}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows: 

[A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module].

Mathematically, we denote [definition of key components]. 

We propose a method for [task] in an [approach type]: [description of the methodology]. 

To cope with the problem of [challenge], we introduce [additional concept or technique]. 

Furthermore, [explanation of key theoretical framework]. 

In information theory, [definition and interpretation of the key terms]. 

Based on this understanding, we establish the following [cost formulation or optimization goal]: 
\[
\text{Equation or formula here}
\]

\subsection{Variational Approach}

In practice, [discussion of practical challenges]. 

Fortunately, we can [address challenge] by defining [auxiliary concept or technique]. 

This allows us to [explenation of implication], leading to the following expression: 
\[
\text{Equation or formula here}
\]

Lemma [lemma number]: [statement of lemma]. 

Using [lemma or theorem], we can express our approach as: 
\[
\text{Lower bound or other relevant equation}
\]

We note that [key observation or important fact]. 

Hence, we formulate our approach as the following optimization problem: 
\[
\text{Minimax game formulation equation}
\]

\subsection{Implementation}

In practice, we [describe implementation details]. 

We [describe additional configurations or structures used]. 

When [specific conditions or assumptions], we [optimize/configure additional parameters or models]. 

Despite [challenging aspects or requirements], we [conclude on efficiency or execution]. 

Finally, [or describe experimental setup or planned evaluations]. 

[Detailed experimental setup is described in Appendix].
