\section{Introduction}

The problem this paper addresses is that of [insert general research problem or challenge]. Specifically, we investigate [describe specific aspect or question]. The classical approach to this problem is [briefly define traditional methods or theories related to the problem]. This is often achieved by [describe the general method used in the classical approach], which involves solving the optimization problem:

\begin{equation}
\max_{\theta \in [parameter space]} [insert objective function involving data]
\end{equation}

If the real data distribution [insert notation] admits a [describe the concept, e.g., density, function], and [insert definition or notation for parametric family], then, asymptotically, this relates to minimizing [insert mathematical concept, e.g., divergence]:

\begin{equation}
\text{minimize} [insert divergence notation]
\end{equation}

However, this requires that [insert conditions or limitations that impact the method's applicability]. This limitation is particularly evident in situations where [describe common misconception or issue]. 

To enhance the traditional framework, one typical approach is to [insert method or adjustment suggested to remedy the issues]. For instance, [provide a specific yet generalized example or scenario that demonstrates the issue]. It is known that [insert supporting evidence, findings, or references, while generalizing the context].

Rather than relying on [insert classical representation], we suggest defining [insert alternative concept or variable] with a fixed [insert attribute, e.g., distribution function] and passing it through [insert type of function or mapping mechanism], which allows for [insert advantages of the new approach]. This approach serves two main purposes: [insert first advantage] and [insert second advantage].

Examples of previous works that follow this approach include [insert broad types of methods or frameworks]. Notably, [insert brief findings regarding previous works and common challenges associated with them].

In this paper, we focus on [insert primary aim of the study]. The vital distinction between such measures is [insert key theoretical aspect that underpins the research]. In this context, [insert brief explanation of how the current study fits into the theoretical framework, potentially referring to other sections].

In order to optimize [insert parameters or function], we aim to define the model distribution [insert notation] under the condition that [insert desired properties or characteristics]. Achieving continuity in the mapping [insert notation] is crucial, as it implies that [insert necessary implications of continuity].
