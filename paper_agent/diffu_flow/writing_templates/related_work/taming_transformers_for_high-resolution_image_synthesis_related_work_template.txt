\subsection{Transformer Architectures}
The defining characteristic of [Transformer architecture type] is that it models interactions between its inputs solely through [mechanism used, e.g., attention], which enables [describe the capability]. Originally applied to [domain, e.g., language tasks], inputs to [Transformer name] were given by [input type], but other signals, such as [alternative signal types], can also be utilized. Each layer of [Transformer name] consists of [describe layer structure], allowing for [explain interaction capability]. More specifically, [detail on mechanism used] can be described as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \text{[Mathematical formulation of the key components]}
\end{equation}

[Details about the method of learning and challenges faced, including computational complexities and their implications]. Different approaches have been proposed to [state the problem being addressed]. [List alternative methods and their contributions with brief descriptions].

\subsection{Convolutional Approaches}
The [structure of objects, e.g., two-dimensional structure of images] suggests that [important property]. [Type of model, e.g., CNNs] exploit this structure by restricting interactions between input variables to [describe neighborhood interactions]. This results in costs that scale [describe scaling], which leads to [consequences of this approach]. However, [explain the limitations].

[Discuss the performance of convolutional architectures in relation to the proposed method, comparing them]. [Explain how the new approach addresses limitations or adds advantages over existing methods].

\subsection{Two-Stage Approaches}
Closest to our approach are [type of approaches]. [List examples and discuss their contributions]. [Explain the advantages of learning representations in two stages]. 

[Discuss subsequent methods that expand on these ideas and their implications]. Our approach demonstrates [key advantage] while overcoming [limitations of previous methods not capturing a certain property].
