\section{Conclusion}

This paper addressed the fundamental challenges that [briefly describe the primary challenge or limitation]. Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [specific challenge or issue]. Our approach [describe the innovative aspect of the approach and its significance, e.g., “leverages [technology or methodology] to enhance [specific outcome or benefit]”].

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Component 1]: [brief description of component 1 and its purpose]
    \item [Component 2]: [brief description of component 2 and its purpose]
    \item [Component 3]: [brief description of component 3 and its purpose]
\end{itemize}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Several sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method. Discuss the relevance and implications of the findings here.]

Furthermore, [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module and how the components integrate]. This approach demonstrates [highlight key results or findings].
