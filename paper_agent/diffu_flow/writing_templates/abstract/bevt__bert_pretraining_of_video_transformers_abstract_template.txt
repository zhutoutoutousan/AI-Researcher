This paper studies the [area of study]. It is a [description of the significance] extension given the [context or previous work]. We introduce [module name], which [describe the main functionality of the module]. In particular, [module name] [detailed description of the methodology]. This design is motivated by two observations: 1) [first observation]; 2) [second observation]. We conduct extensive experiments on [number] challenging benchmarks where [module name] achieves [summary of results]. On [Benchmark 1], where [describe the nature of the benchmark], [module name] achieves [results]. On [Benchmark 2], which [describe the nature of the benchmark], [module name] outperforms [comparison with baselines] and achieves [result]. Code will be made available at [link to code repository].

\section{Introduction}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. 

\section{Methodology}

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Component 1]
    \item [Component 2]
    \item [Component 3]
\end{itemize}
Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}
Where [detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

\section{Experiments}

[Paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

Specifically, we evaluate [module name] on [list of benchmarks]. 

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Approaches}

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches].

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have [summary of major findings and implications]. Future work includes [suggestions for further research].
