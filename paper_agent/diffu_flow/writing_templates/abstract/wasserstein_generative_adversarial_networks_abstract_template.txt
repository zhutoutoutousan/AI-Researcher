\section{Abstract}

We introduce a new algorithm named [Algorithm Name], an alternative to [existing method/approach]. In this new model, we demonstrate that we can [specific improvement or goal], address issues such as [problem 1, problem 2], and provide [benefit or outcome] useful for [use case]. Furthermore, we establish that the corresponding optimization problem is [description of optimization nature], and provide extensive theoretical work highlighting the [relationship/connection] to [other concepts/metrics involved].

\paragraph{Motivation} 

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

\paragraph{Method Overview} 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Specifically, [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module].

\paragraph{Comparison with Existing Approaches}
