\section{INTRODUCTION}  
Most methods in [research area] are based on [general method/technique], chosen to [explain purpose]. However, the [state the challenge or limitation]. These may be significantly reduced through the use of [related technique or improvement], inspired by [previous work or models]. [Optional: Discuss additional relevant prior work].

To address [specific challenge], we propose [module name] that consists of [number of components, e.g., three main components: component 1, component 2, and component 3]. 

Specifically, our [module name] transform consists of [list the stages or key processes involved]. We represent the [input terms at various stages] as follows:  
\[
\text{[Input representation equation]}
\]  
where [explain key variables or notation].

Each stage begins with [describe the first operation or process]:  
\[
\text{[First operation equation]}  
\]  
followed by [second operation]:  
\[
\text{[Second operation equation]}  
\]  
and concludes with [final operation]:  
\[
\text{[Final operation equation]}  
\]  
The full set of [parameters] constitute the parameter vector [symbol for parameters].

The synthesis transform [named or described] consists of [describe the stages and adjustments in order]. We define [input terms at various synthesis stages] as follows:  
\[
\text{[Input representation for synthesis equation]}
\]  
Each stage includes [describe the operations conducted in the synthesis stage sequence]:  
\[
\text{[Operations equations]}
\]  
analogously, the set of [parameters for synthesis] make up the parameter vector [symbol for synthesis parameters]. 

Furthermore, in previous work, we utilized [a method or concept] optimized to [specific purpose or requirement]. Here, we [state any modifications or current decisions]. This approach not only [benefit of current approach], but also allows for [possible application or improvement].
