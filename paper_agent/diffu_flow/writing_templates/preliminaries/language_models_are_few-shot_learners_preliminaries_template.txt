\section{Approach}

Our basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to [reference], with a straightforward scaling up of [model size, dataset size, diversity, training duration]. Our use of [approach] is also akin to [reference], but in this work, we systematically explore different settings for [learning technique]:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Component 1} - [Detailed explanation of this component, including advantages and disadvantages]. We focus on [mention the focus area], leaving [other components] for future work.
    
    \item \textbf{Component 2} - [Description of this component]. [Detailed explanation, including advantages, disadvantages, and settings].
    
    \item \textbf{Component 3} - [Description of this component].
    
    \item \textbf{Component 4} - [Description of this component].
\end{itemize}

The appendix includes a demonstration of the methods using the example of [task]. While [comparison of performances], [other approaches] seem like [comparison statement] for future work.

\subsection{Model and Architectures}

We use the same model and architecture as [reference], including [specific details], with the exception that we [any deviations or improvements]. To study the dependence of [performance metric] on [variable], we train [number] different sizes of model, ranging from [smallest size] to [largest size]. This range allows us to test the scaling laws introduced in [reference].

More details on the sizes and architectures of our models can be found in the appendix. We partition each model across [dimensional aspect] in order to minimize [data-transfer issue].

\subsection{Training Dataset}

To create our training data, we [explain the data creation process]. This involves [detailed steps of data creation, like filtering, deduplication, augmentation, etc.].

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Performance on [task].}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Setting & Metric 1 & Metric 2 & Metric 3 & Metric 4 \\ \hline
SOTA   & [value]  & [value]  & [value]  & [value]  \\ \hline
Proposed Method 1 & [value]  & [value]  & [value]  & [value]  \\ \hline
[Additional settings as necessary]            \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Training Process}

As found in [reference], [contextual information about training]. We measure [specific metric during training] to guide our choice of [model hyperparameter]. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Parameter settings.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Parameter & Value \\ \hline
[Parameter 1] & [Value 1] \\ \hline
[Parameter 2] & [Value 2] \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To train the larger models without running out of memory, we use [techniques for model training]. All models were trained on [hardware specifications]. Details of the training process and hyperparameter settings are described in the appendix.

\subsection{Evaluation}

For [specific technique], we evaluate [description of evaluation method]. For tasks without a specific training set, we [explain approach taken]. 

For some tasks, we use [additional methods or prompts]. We also use [specify any techniques used]. See the appendix for [mention any relevant examples or details].

Final results are reported on [dataset] when publicly available, for each model size and learning setting ([zero-, one-, few-shot]). When the test set is private, we report results on [alternative dataset or situation].
