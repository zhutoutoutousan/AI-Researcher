\begin{itemize}
    \item [Term 1: Explanation]
    \item [Term 2: Explanation]
    \item [Term 3: Explanation]
\end{itemize}

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. 

To this end, [concluding remarks that summarize the background and lead into the next section].
