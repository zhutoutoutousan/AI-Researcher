\section{Method}

The goal of [Module Name] is to [main objective]. Here, [define any specific terms or categories relevant to the work]. Besides the effectiveness, another key problem to consider is [mention a secondary challenge related to the main objective].

To this end, [Module Name] [describe the proposed solution or approach to tackle the challenges]. Our method consists of [number] main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. In the following, we introduce the different components of our framework. Figure \ref{fig:framework_overview} gives an overview of our framework.

\subsection{[First Component]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method for the first component.]

\subsubsection{[Description of Input Data]}

[Paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the first component, mentioning any specific data processing or handling.]

\subsection{[Second Component]}

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches in this area.]

\subsubsection{[Mathematical Formulation]}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Detailed explanation of each term in the equations.]

\subsection{[Third Component]}

[Description of this component and its significance in the overall method.]

\subsubsection{[Training Objectives]}

Denote the [specific terms or positions] as [appropriate variables or symbols]. The objective is to maximize [describe the goals or outcomes of the training tasks]:

\begin{equation}
L = [specific objective function]
\end{equation}

\subsection{[Training Strategies]}

Following our design, we first [explain initial training strategy or steps]. The resulting model is then [describe how components are trained and their convergence process].

\subsection{[Weight Sharing Strategy]}

When jointly training the components, we implement a [describe the strategy]. This involves [specific adjustments or methodologies applied].

\subsection{[Finetuning and Inference]}

Once pretrained, [Module Name] provides [describe what developments are available for downstream tasks]. On targeted datasets, we [explain the finetuning strategy or additional layers used]. The resulting model can then be readily used for [specific applications]. 

Figure \ref{fig:framework_components} illustrates [describe what the figure represents in terms of the module components].
