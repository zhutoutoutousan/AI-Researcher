\section{Related Work}

Existing attempts towards [specific research challenge or domain]. Thanks to the understanding of [limitations/insights from previous research], there have been several developments in [field/methodology] which [describe advancements or improvements]. By design, [specific models or techniques] are able to [describe capabilities or advantages] to some extent. Similarly, some recent [models/methods] have been designed to [describe purpose or function]. However, most of such architectures are evaluated on benchmarks where it is not clear whether [specific aspect] is required for the corresponding [task/learning].

For [another domain or context], the [specific benchmark] has been instrumental in studying [describe significance or impact of benchmark]. Notably, a recent work has introduced [new datasets/approaches] that is an orthogonal attempt to contribute towards [describe objective or aim].

Nevertheless, we believe there is a consensus in the community towards the development of [specific goals/benchmarks] that can assist [specific methodologies/approaches]. This can be observed in existing independent attempts at proposing [describe previous efforts or investigations]. In [Author et al. \cite{reference}], a new [specific benchmark] was used to evaluate the ability of [specific method/model] in [describe capability]. Similarly, a [describe synthetic or specific task] was used in [Author et al. \cite{reference}] to demonstrate [describe capabilities of a model]. Another [task/benchmark] was used in [Author et al. \cite{reference}] to probe [specific phenomenon or issue] and implement [describe method]. Finally, a [describe dataset] was created for testing [specific aspects] that was adopted to develop [describe enhanced models or approaches]. Apart from the aforementioned [tasks/benchmarks], [describe another dataset or aspect] could be a potential [specific application or task] given its [describe relevant characteristics], which we discuss in Section [X] as a characterizing aspect of [specific research challenge], along with other factors.
