\section{Related Work}

Neural tangent kernels were introduced in [\textit{citation}], and similar ideas were used to obtain more quantitative guarantees on the global convergence of gradient descent for over-parameterized neural networks [\textit{citations}]. Specifically, we can expand on the initial concepts by including [\textit{specific ideas or methodologies}]. 

Furthermore, kernel methods for deep neural networks were studied, including [\textit{citations for specific studies}]. In particular, our approach differs from [\textit{previous works}] by [\textit{describe the key differences}].
