\textbf{[Category One Description].} [Citation(s)] is the first work to [describe significant contribution and methodology]. The authors in [Citation(s)] further [improvement or extension]. Additionally, [related technique/model] is used to [related analysis or findings]. [Transition sentence emphasizing key differences or focus].

\textbf{[Category Two Description].} The authors in [Citation(s)] analyze the [related aspect] of [topic], providing [discussion of findings]. [Citation(s)] is the first work to [describe a specific contribution related to generalization]. [Additional references] extend this work by [outlining their specific contributions or techniques]. Furthermore, [Citation(s)] transforms [general concept] into [specific method or framework], producing [results/implications]. Observing these gaps, [Citation(s)] proposes [new approach or framework] to analyze [specific topic] in the context of [context or finding]. 

The work most related to ours is [Citation(s)], where the authors [describe the relationship]. However, the [critical limitation or unresolved question]. Differently from [previous work], we aim to [describe your contribution or different perspective].
