\section{Related Work}

Among the methods that differ from [existing techniques], [Previous Work 1 (authors, year)] represents one of the state-of-the-art approaches that is related to our [proposed method]. It can be observed that [Previous Work 1] as well as [Previous Work 2 (authors, year)] are special cases of our model since [Brief explanation of how these works relate to the current model]. These [weight choices/methods/techniques] correspond to [concept or established theory] which is known to be suboptimal compared to [alternative method] when applied to [specific application area].

Fixing the [parameters/weights] makes the model unable to [describe the limitation], which is of crucial importance. As we will show in Section [X], the fixed [parameters] correspond to [concept in the context of the problem], which renders them inadequate for [specific scenario]. The recent work [Previous Work 3 (authors, year)] demonstrated that fixed [parameters/weights] can also [describe another limitation or issue]. However, the way [Previous Work 1] handles [issue] is [contrast statement]. In contrast, the escape of [Proposed Method] from [issue] is guided by [additional concept or information] (Theorem [X.X]). A detailed discussion of this phenomenon along with illustrative examples is delegated to the Supplement.

Among the [related models/types], [Comparison Model (authors, year)] exhibits some similarities with [Proposed Method]. It also [describe similarity]. On the other hand, [Another Comparison Model (authors, year)] is related to [concept or method], where [explain how it operates]. In both cases, the [aspect] of the models is limited in practice [reference work], and they are not easy to interpret as our [Proposed Method]. Some prior work also emphasizes [another relevant point or methodology] [references]. Nevertheless, none of the above works is applicable for [describe the limitation of existing works relevant to your research] and considers [specific scenario/context].
