\section{Comparisons to Related Work}

The [module/approach name] described in subsection [X.Y] directly addresses several issues that were present in prior approaches to [specific domain/area]:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency:} [Multiple sentences explaining the computational efficiency of the proposed method. Include any relevant time complexity comparisons with existing methods.]
    
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} [Several sentences discussing the advantages of the proposed method compared to baseline methods, highlighting its ability to handle different scenarios or data structures.]
    
    \item \textbf{Generalizability:} [A paragraph explaining how the proposed method can be applied to various contexts or datasets, noting any restrictions present in previous techniques.]
    
    \item \textbf{Limitations of Previous Work:} [Discussion on the shortcomings of existing methods that the proposed method overcomes, explaining any assumptions made in prior approaches and how they differ from yours.]
    
    \item \textbf{Relation to Similar Models:} [Discussion on how the proposed method relates to other models, including specific conditions or formulations that align it with established work in the field.]
\end{itemize}

We were able to produce a version of [module/approach] that [summary of improvement or novel contribution], addressing [specific challenges]. However, [description of limitations encountered with the current implementation and potential future work]. 

Additionally, it is important to note that [observations about performance, architecture, or computational concerns that may affect the application of the method]. Techniques such as [mention any relevant techniques or methods that could be integrated] could be readily applied for enhancing the performance or effectiveness.
