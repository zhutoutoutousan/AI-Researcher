\section{Conclusion}

Recent empirical findings in [field/technique] have demonstrated that [key insight or observation] is an integral part of [application or system]. In particular, these results enable [specific context or element] to benefit from [method or architecture]. Our major contribution is [brief statement of contribution], allowing [application or benefit of the contribution].

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

Furthermore, we provide [a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module].

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

Specifically, we compare our proposed method with existing approaches. [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]

Lastly, we elaborate on the details of our formulation. [Detailed explanation of each term in the equations]
