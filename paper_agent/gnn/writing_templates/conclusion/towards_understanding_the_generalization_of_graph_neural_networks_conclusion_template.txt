\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

In this paper, we establish [key findings or contributions] for [topic/technique], by which [describe results or implications]. Experimental results on [datasets/contexts] support the [theoretical/empirical] results. This work sheds light on [broader implications or applications] and provides insights into [future research directions or design principles].

Although we have made efforts in [specific area of research], there are still some limitations in our analysis, which is left for future work to address: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [First limitation with brief explanation and potential future direction]
    \item [Second limitation with brief explanation and potential future direction]
    \item [Third limitation with brief explanation and potential future direction]
\end{enumerate} 

Specifically, [summarize major points, emphasize the significance of the findings, and suggest further avenues of research]. Furthermore, [relate findings to the broader field or future understanding]. To this end, [final thoughts or concluding remarks, possibly including a call to action or encouragement for future work].
