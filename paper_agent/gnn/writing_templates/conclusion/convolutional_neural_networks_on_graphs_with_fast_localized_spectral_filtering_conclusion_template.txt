\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we have introduced [general methodology/technique] that addresses [specific challenge]. Our experiments have demonstrated [key findings or advantages of the approach, e.g. performance metrics or capabilities]. Specifically, our approach [describe key benefit] when compared to [previous work/technique] introduced in [reference]. 

To this end, we provided [a brief summary of key contributions or improvements, e.g., computational efficiency, accuracy, robustness]. We also addressed the concerns raised by [reference] regarding [list key concerns addressed, e.g., computational complexity, data quality, model assumptions]. 

Future works will investigate [mention two or more directions for future research]. On one hand, we will [describe enhancement/improvement direction, e.g., incorporating new tools or methods]. On the other hand, we will explore [describe application direction, e.g., deploying the model in relevant fields]. Another natural future approach would be [mention a method or technique for further exploration].
