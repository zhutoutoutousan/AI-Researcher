\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we presented [Module Name], [a brief description or significance of the module], replacing [previously used technique or model] with [new approach or method].

For [specific tasks or applications], [our approach] can [describe advantages, such as efficiency or performance improvements]. On [specific task or benchmark], we achieve [describe results, such as state of the art or significant improvements]. In the former task, our best model [describe key performance metrics or comparisons with prior works].

We are excited about the future of [research area or technique] and plan to [describe future research directions]. We aim to [list specific goals or extensions of the work, such as applying to new problems or improving existing methods].

The code we used to [describe functionality] is available at [link to code repository]. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Inspiration: Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge].
    \item Method Components: To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].
    \item Formal Definition: Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
    \[
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
    \]
    \item Intuition: [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].
    \item Workflow: [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module].
