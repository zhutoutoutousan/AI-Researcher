\section{Conclusion}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Specifically, [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module].

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}
Where [Detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

We complement these results by showing that [discuss any trade-offs or costs associated with the method]. Furthermore, we provide [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches].

Empirically, [Module name] demonstrates [state-of-the-art results or highlights on relevant tasks] such as [task 1] and [task 2]. Additionally, we further introduce [any additional applications or extensions related to the proposed method] and fine-tune it for [specific downstream tasks]. 

In conclusion, our work presents [final thoughts on the significance of the proposed method and its implications in the field].
