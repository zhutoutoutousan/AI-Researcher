\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we addressed [summarize the primary challenges or weaknesses of existing methods]. Inspired by [previous work/techniques], we propose [module name] to address [specific challenge or issue]. 

To tackle [specific challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Specifically, [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. 

Furthermore, we define [concept or framework] as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}
We elaborate on each term in the equation: [detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

Our experiments on [description of experimental setup or datasets] demonstrate [main findings or performance results]. We evaluated [module name] against existing approaches and showed [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. 

Moreover, [include additional findings or insights that add value or interest]. This work opens avenues for [discuss potential future work or implications].
