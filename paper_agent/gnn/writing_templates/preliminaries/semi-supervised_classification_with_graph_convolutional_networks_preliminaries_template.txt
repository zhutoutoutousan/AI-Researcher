\section{[SECTION TITLE]}

In this section, we provide theoretical motivation for a specific [domain/technique] that we will use in the rest of this paper. We consider a [describe the model/system] with the following [component/structure]:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical representation of the model/system]
\end{equation}

Here, [explain terms and variables in the equation]. In the following, we show that the form of this [model/system] can be motivated via [briefly state concept or method being referenced].

\subsection{[SUBSECTION TITLE]}

We consider [discuss specific aspect of the method] defined as [conceptual definition or established method]:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical representation of the process]
\end{equation}

where [define terms, matrices, or other notation]. Specifically, we can understand [key concept or component]. Evaluating [equation or concept] is [describe computational complexity or relevant challenges]. To circumvent this problem, it was suggested in [reference] that [briefly state proposed solution or alternative method].

Revisiting our definition of [conceptual process], we now have:

\begin{equation}
[Updated mathematical expression]
\end{equation}

with [describe implications/findings from this expression]. Note that this expression is now [describe characteristics or properties]. The complexity of evaluating [equation] is [describe complexity in terms of variables].

\subsection{[ANOTHER SUBSECTION TITLE]}

A [describe main goal of this subsection] can therefore be built by [briefly describe the process or components]. Now, consider [describe specific condition or assumption being made, e.g., a limit]. In this way, [describe expected outcomes or benefits of this approach].

Furthermore, we intuitively expect that [state hypothesis or expected findings]. In this context, we can simplify [reference a previous equation or concept]:

\begin{equation}
[Further simplified expression]
\end{equation}

with [define new parameters or variables]. [Discuss potential issues or considerations]. To alleviate this problem, we introduce [describe solution or adjustment].

We can generalize this definition to a [describe the broader framework or model] as follows:

\begin{equation}
[General mathematical expression]
\end{equation}

where [explain what each term or variable represents]. This [operation/component] has complexity [state complexity in terms of variables], as [describe implementation or computational details].
