\section{Approach}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. Our basic approach consists of [brief overview of the approach, highlighting key components and innovations]. 

To tackle [specific challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Component 1:} [description of component 1 and its function]
    \item \textbf{Component 2:} [description of component 2 and its function]
    \item \textbf{Component 3:} [description of component 3 and its function]
\end{itemize}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Motivation and Intuition}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

\subsection{Method Workflow}

[A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module.]

\subsection{Comparative Analysis}

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches, discussing advantages and disadvantages.]

\subsection{Model and Architectures}

We utilize [description of the model and architecture used] with the following modifications: [list modifications]. Our experiments involve [description of the range of models and their sizes].

More details on the architectures can be found in [reference to appendix or supplementary material].

\subsection{Training Dataset}

To create our training data, we follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Step 1: Describe the initial data collection and filtering process.]
    \item [Step 2: Explain the deduplication process and its significance.]
    \item [Step 3: Detail the augmentation of training data with additional sources.]
\end{enumerate}

These steps ensure [brief explanation of how these methods contribute to the dataset quality].
