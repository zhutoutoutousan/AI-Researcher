\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

The motivation behind our approach is [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. 

\subsection{Notations}
\label{subsec:notations}

We denote [concept] as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}
where [detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

In this section, we introduce our notations. Let [define notation 1]. We also define [define notation 2]. 

\subsection{Framework}
\label{subsec:framework}

Currently, most existing [related methods] are designed based on [current method's framework]. Denote [concept] as [definition]. 

Given [context], the output representation at layer [layer number] is computed by [explanation]. We have:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the framework]
\end{equation}
where [description of each function and its role]. 

After [number of layers] layers of processing, [final representation] is used as [purpose of this representation]. 

To obtain the overall representation, we use a readout function:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the readout]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Generalization to [K-hop/Other Framework]}
\label{subsec:generalization}

Our framework can be directly generalized to [new framework], utilizing [key mechanism]. The main difference is [explanation of differences].

We define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

[Detailed explanation of the new concept, including comparisons to previous frameworks, if applicable].

We now present the [new framework details, including key equations and concepts]:
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
where [explanation of components in this equation]. 

Compared to [previous framework], [new framework] introduces [new elements and improvements]. 

We further discuss the implications of [new framework] and its potential applications in [specific contexts]. 

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{subsec:conclusion}

In this section, we summarize our findings and the impact of our method on [research domain].
