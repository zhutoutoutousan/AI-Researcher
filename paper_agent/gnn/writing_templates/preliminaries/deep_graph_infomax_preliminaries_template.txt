\section{[Main Section Title]}

In this section, we present [method/approach] in a top-down fashion: starting with an overview of our [specific technique/setup], followed by a description of the objective/function optimized by our method, and concluding by detailing the steps of our procedure in a [specific setting].

\subsection{[Subsection Title 1]}

We assume a generic [description of setup, e.g., unsupervised machine learning setup]: we are provided with [input data description, e.g., a set of features], where [definition of variables]. Our objective is to [describe the goal, e.g., learn an encoder]. Formally, we define [concept] as follows: 

\[
[Mathematical formulation of the concept]
\]

Specifically, we will focus on [specific architecture/approach], which [describe the key characteristics or benefits]. 

\subsection{[Subsection Title 2]}

To tackle [specific challenge], our method consists of [number] main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

Our approach aims to [describe the main objective]. In order to achieve this, we leverage [function/method] to [describe purpose of the function]. 

Negative samples for our approach are generated using [describe sampling approach]. 

To define our objective, we follow the intuition from [previous work] and use [describe the objective function or loss function]. We can express this objective mathematically as follows:

\[
L = [Mathematical formulation of the objective]
\]

This formulation allows us to [describe the effect or outcome].

\subsection{[Subsection Title 3]}

We now provide some intuition that connects [concept 1] to [concept 2]. 

\begin{lemma}
Let [describe the lemma or theorem statement].
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
[Provide the proof or explanation].
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Assuming that [condition], we conclude that [describe the corollary].
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
[Describe the theorem statement].
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
[Provide the proof or explanation].
\end{proof}

This motivates our use of [specific approach or method] to [goal related to the topic].

\subsection{[Overview Section Title]}

Assuming the [specific setup], we summarize the steps of the [name of method/procedure] procedure: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Step 1 description]
    \item [Step 2 description]
    \item [Step 3 description]
    \item [Step 4 description]
    \item [Step 5 description]
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm is fully summarized by [description of any relevant figure or diagram].
