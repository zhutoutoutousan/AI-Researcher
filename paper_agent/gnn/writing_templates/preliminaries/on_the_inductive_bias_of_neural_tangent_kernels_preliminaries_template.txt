\section{Introduction}

In this section, we provide background on [topic] and introduce the [methods/tools] that we study in this paper. In particular, we derive the [key derivation] for [specific application]. For simplicity of exposition, we focus on [specific case], noting that the [methods/tools] can be extended to [broader case], as done in [relevant citation].

\subsection{Background on [subtopic]}

Multiple recent works studying [related field/application] (e.g., [citation1, citation2, citation3]) show that when [specific conditions], [key observation]. The model can be approximated by its [mathematical/computational process], expressed as follows:

\begin{equation} 
f(x; \theta) \approx f(x; \theta_0) + \langle \theta - \theta_0, \nabla_\theta f(x; \theta_0) \rangle. 
\end{equation}

This regime, where [describe regime], contrasts with [other method/approach], which operates under [explain conditions]. Yet, with sufficient [parameterization/conditions], the [features/methods] become expressive enough to [achieve goal or fit data].

\textbf{Definition of [key concept].} When [conditions/assumptions], we can show that [key results/formulation], leading to [further implications]:

\begin{equation}
\langle \nabla_\theta f(x; \theta_0), \nabla_\theta f(x', \theta_0) \rangle \to K(x, x').
\end{equation}

Under [specific assumptions], it can be shown that [details]. In the case of [specific condition], one can demonstrate that [further implications].

\textbf{Key Models/Methods.} Consider [describe model/method] defined by [equation or representation of the model], where [parameters/variables] are [description]. We treat [certain condition] similarly to [previous work], noting [further details].

The [key formulation] can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
K(x, x') = [mathematical expression for K],
\end{equation}

where [explain components of the equation]. 

\subsection{Feature Maps Construction}

We now provide a reformulation of the [concept] in terms of [explain reformulation], which provides [benefits or conveniences]. 

\textbf{Lemma [Number]. (Feature Mapping for [specific model]):} The [key concept] can be defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
K(x, x') = \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(x') \rangle,
\end{equation}

with [definitions of terms in lemma for various layers/models].

\subsection{Extension to [another model or application]}

In this section, we study [new models or applications], focusing on [particular aspects]. We consider [description of model or system], expressed as:

\begin{equation}
f(x; \theta) = [key formula for the new model].
\end{equation}

We are now ready to state our result on [key results for this model].

\textbf{Proposition [Number]. (Main Result for [model]):} The [key result] is given by

\begin{equation}
K(x, x') = \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(x') \rangle,
\end{equation}

with [description of recursive definitions or equations].

The proof is given in [specific section], where we also show that [key implication or finding related to the results]. The proof relies on [key methods or techniques used in the proof] and exploits [certain characteristics of the models discussed].
