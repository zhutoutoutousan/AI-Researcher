\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Key Concept 1}
\label{sec:key_concept_1}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

\begin{equation}
\text{Wasserstein distance} \ W_2(A, B) = \sqrt{ \inf_{(X, Y) \text{s.t.} X \sim A, Y \sim B} \mathbb{E} \left[ | X - Y |^2 \right] }
\end{equation}

\subsection{Key Concept 2}
\label{sec:key_concept_2}

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

\subsubsection{Mathematical Foundation}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{definition}
\text{[Definition of the concept]}
\end{definition}

\begin{equation}
\text{Mathematical Definition: } [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

Where [detailed explanation of each term in the equations].
