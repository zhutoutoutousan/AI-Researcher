\section{Approach}
  
\subsection{Natural Language Supervision}
At the core of our approach is the idea of [motivating idea or principle]. This concept, while not new, has seen varied terminology in prior work such as [reference previous works], which describe their methods as [description of methodologies]. 

We emphasize that the commonality across this body of work lies in [explanation of shared understanding or common theme]. Recent advancements in [related advancements] suggest that we now have the tools to leverage [specific advantage or opportunity].

Learning from [data type] has several potential strengths over alternative methods. [Discussion on advantages compared to other methods]. In the following subsections, we detail the specific approach we adopted.

\subsection{Creating a Sufficiently Large Dataset}
Existing research has primarily used [name of existing datasets]. While these datasets have [qualities of the datasets], they are [limitations of the datasets]. 

A major motivation for using [proposed data source] is [explanation of the data source's advantages]. To address this gap, we constructed a new dataset comprising [dataset description and size]. The dataset was designed to [explanation of dataset's structure or purpose].

\subsection{Selecting an Efficient Pre-Training Method}
State-of-the-art systems typically require [discussion on computational needs]. In our efforts, we found that [key observation about the importance of efficiency]. 

Initially, we attempted [initial approach], which faced [challenges encountered]. [Description of alternative methods and their benefits]. We explored training a system to solve [alternative objective], which yielded [results or observations].

Given a batch of [description of data pair structure], we [describe training methodology and objectives, including loss functions and optimizations]. The training process was inspired by [reference relevant methodology] and adapted to [specific adjustments made].

\subsection{Choosing and Scaling a Model}
We considered two different architectures for [component type]. The first architecture employed [description of first architecture], while the second involved [description of second architecture].

The [second component] followed [architecture name] with [details on modifications]. For [specific configurations], we adapted the strategy of [reference previous work] to achieve [aim or goal of adjustment].

\subsection{Training}
We trained a series of [types of models and variations]. For instance, we trained [list of models], with each model subjected to [description of training conditions and parameters]. 

Hyperparameters were set using a combination of [techniques used for hyperparameter setting]. We observed [any specific findings during training]. The training duration varied with the model size, with [scheduling of the training and resources used]. 

The results reported in this study utilize [specific model or configuration], which showed the best performance.
