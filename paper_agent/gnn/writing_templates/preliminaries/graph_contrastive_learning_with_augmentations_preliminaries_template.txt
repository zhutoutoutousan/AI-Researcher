\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Augmentation for Graphs}

Data augmentation aims at creating novel and realistically rational data through applying certain transformations without affecting the semantic label. However, it remains under-explored for graphs, aside from a few methods that involve expensive computational costs (see Sec. \ref{previous_work_section}). In this research, we focus on graph-level augmentations. Given a graph $G \in \{G_m : m \in M\}$ in the dataset of $M$ graphs, we formulate the augmented graph $\hat{G}$ satisfying: 

\begin{equation}
\hat{G} \sim q(\hat{G}|G),
\end{equation}

where $q(\cdot|G)$ represents the augmentation distribution conditioned on the original graph, which is pre-defined and reflects the human prior for data distribution. 

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. Specifically, our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

\subsubsection{Challenges and Considerations}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

To tackle [challenge], we categorize different graph datasets and identify potential augmentation strategies. We mainly focus on [category 1], [category 2], and [category 3]. Next, we propose [number] general data augmentations for graph-structured data and discuss the intuitive priors they introduce.

[Data augmentation 2]      & [Type 2]     & [Underlying prior 2]      \\ \hline
[Data augmentation 3]      & [Type 3]     & [Underlying prior 3]      \\ \hline
[Data augmentation 4]      & [Type 4]     & [Underlying prior 4]      \\ \hline
