\section{[Main Topic Title]}

The primary challenge faced in [context/field] is [describe the main challenge or difficulty]. Although [describe any straightforward methods or techniques], these approaches typically [describe limitations, such as memory cost or numerical errors].

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [specific challenge]. This approach [describe how it works, emphasizing efficiency and error management].

To formally define [concept], we express it as follows:
\begin{equation}
[Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:label} illustrates [provide a brief description of the figure's content].

To optimize [objective/function], we require [explain what is needed, e.g., gradients with respect to parameters]. The first step involves [describe the first step and introduce any relevant concepts, such as ‘adjoint’]. Its dynamics can be described by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
[Mathematical expression]
\end{equation}

Next, we can compute [explain how to compute required gradients or values, and introduce necessary equations]:
\begin{equation}
[Mathematical expression]
\end{equation}

The [describe what must be computed and how it can be efficiently managed, mentioning any techniques used]. This process [describe the efficiency or computational advantages, referencing automatic differentiation or other technologies].

Most [relevant methods or tools] have the capability to [describe any relevant features, such as outputting multiple states]. When [explain conditions that require specific handling], the [explain how to manage the adjoint or gradients].

The results above extend those of [previous work/reference]. Additional details can be found in Appendix [reference appropriate appendix letter for detailed derivations]. Appendix [next letter] provides [describe what is included, e.g., code or implementations] related to [subject or tool].

Finally, we have [mention any recent advancements or releases pertinent to the topic or tool].
