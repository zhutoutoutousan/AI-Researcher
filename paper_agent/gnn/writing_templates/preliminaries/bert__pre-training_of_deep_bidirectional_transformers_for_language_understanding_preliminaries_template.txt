\section{Preliminaries}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [component 1]
    \item [component 2]
    \item [component 3]
\end{itemize}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Motivation and Intuition}
[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

\subsection{Workflow Description}
[A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Approaches}
[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
[Mathematical formulation of the key components]

\subsection{Detailed Explanation of Formulations}
[Detailed explanation of each term in the equations]

Specifically, our contribution is structured as follows: [Brief overview of the sections and components that follow]. 

Furthermore, it is important to highlight [Any critical distinctions or support for the proposed method]. 

To this end, [final remarks or transitions to the next section].
