\section{Numerical Experiments}

In this section, we refer to the following techniques as [Technique 1], [Technique 2], and [Proposed Technique]. We aim to [describe the specific objectives of the experiments].

We use the following notation when describing network architectures: [define architecture components and their notations]. The final layer is always [specify the final layer characteristics] and the loss function is defined as [describe loss function characteristics]. The mini-batch size is set to [specify mini-batch size].

\subsection{Experiment 1: [Title]}

To validate our model, we applied it to [describe the dataset and problem being addressed]. For our model, we constructed [describe the graph structure and its relevant characteristics]. Following standard practices, the weights of [describe weight calculation method].

This serves as an important verification for our model, which must be able to extract features effectively. [Present any relevant results, such as performance measures or tables. Discuss results briefly, providing potential explanations for observed outcomes.]

The [architecture used] and the following hyper-parameters are chosen from [provide reference/source for hyperparameters]: [list hyperparameters].

\subsection{Experiment 2: [Title]}

To demonstrate the versatility of our model, we applied our technique to [describe the second application and dataset]. We [explain the construction method for the graphical representation]. [Present relevant metrics, indicating how the model performs with respect to other methods.]

\subsection{Comparison of [Specific Aspects]}

[State the key focal points of comparison regarding the proposed method and others, using relevant definitions and equations for clarity.]

\subsection{Influence of [Specific Factor]}

For the proposed method to be successful, [discuss the underlying conditions or assumptions]. [Provide statements on the impact of different constructions or methods of analysis employed and summarize experimental results with specific tables or figures demonstrating this influence.]
