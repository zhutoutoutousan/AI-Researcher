\subsection{[Task Name, e.g., Language Modeling, Cloze, and Completion Tasks]}

We test [Model Name]’s performance on the traditional task of [specific task] as well as related tasks. We calculate [measure] on the [dataset name] dataset measured in [reference]. We omit [reason for omission]. Our [model description] sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a substantial margin of [performance improvement].

The [additional dataset name] requires the model to [describe task]. Although [previous work] suggested [related observation], we find that [Model Name] achieves [performance improvement] over the previous SOTA. For the [few-shot/one-shot/zero-shot] setting, we use [specific method or format] to [explain the technique]. With this format, [Model Name] achieves an increase of [performance improvement] from the previous SOTA.

\subsection{[Next Task Name, e.g., Question Answering]}

In this section, we measure [Model Name]’s ability to handle a variety of [specific tasks]. First, we look at datasets involving [describe the nature of the data]. We evaluate in the [specific setting] setting as suggested by [reference]. On [specific dataset], [Model Name]’s performance [compare to prior benchmarks with evidence].

We also [explain comparison or performance for additional datasets].

\subsection{[Another Task Name, e.g., Translation]}

In collecting training data for [Model Name], we used [methodology description]. As a result, although [Model Name]’s training data primarily consists of [main language proportion], it also includes [non-primary language proportion]. Existing [related methodologies] often combine [method] to [explain goal]. By contrast, [Model Name] learns from [describe training data strategy].

We find that zero-shot [Model Name] underperforms [reference works or benchmarks]. However, the [one-shot/few-shot] setting exhibits [describe improvement].

\subsection{[Final Task Name, e.g., SuperGLUE]}

The [Benchmark Name] is a standardized collection of datasets [reference]. In the few-shot setting, we used [number of examples] examples for all tasks, sampled randomly from the training set.

We observe a wide range in [Model Name]’s performance across tasks. Specifically, on [specific tasks], [Model Name] achieves [summary of performance]. However, [additional insights regarding challenges faced].
