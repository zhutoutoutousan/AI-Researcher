\section{Experiments}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [component 1]
    \item [component 2]
    \item [component 3]
\end{itemize}

Specifically, we define [concept] as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

To this end, [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

Furthermore, we compare the proposed method with existing approaches. [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches].

Additionally, we provide a detailed explanation of each term in the equations. [Detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

In summary, the results demonstrate that [summarize the key findings or implications of the experiments].
