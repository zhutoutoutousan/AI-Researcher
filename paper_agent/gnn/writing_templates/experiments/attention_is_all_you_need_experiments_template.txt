\section{Results}

\subsection{[First Task]}

On the [Dataset/Task Description] task, the [Proposed Model Name] (see Table [X]) outperforms the [Best Previously Reported Models] by more than [X] [Performance Metric], establishing a new state-of-the-art [Performance Metric Type]. The configuration of this model is summarized in Table [Y]. Training took [X] on [Hardware Details]. Our [Base/Alternate Model] surpasses all previously published models at a fraction of the training cost of [Comparison Models].

On the [Another Task or Dataset Description], our [Proposed Model Name] achieves a [Performance Metric] of [X], outperforming all of the previously published single models while maintaining a lower training cost than the previous state-of-the-art model. For this model, we used [Hyperparameter Configuration].

For the base models, we used [Description of Model Averaging]. For the big models, we averaged [Description of Checkpoint Averaging]. We utilized [Search Method] with a beam size of [X] and length penalty $\alpha = [Y]$ [Cite Source]. These hyperparameters were chosen after [Description of Experimental Procedure]. We set the maximum output length during inference to [Output Length Specification] but opted to terminate early when possible [Cite Source].

Table [X] summarizes our results and compares our [Task/Quality Metric] and [Training Costs] to other model architectures in the literature. We estimate the number of [Computational Resources/Operations] used to train a model by [Estimation Method].

\subsection{[Model Variations]}

To evaluate the importance of different components of the [Model Type], we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on [Task] on the [Dataset]. We employed [Search Methods], but [Alternate Method] was not used. We present these results in Table [X].

In Table [X] rows (A), we varied [Description of Variations], keeping the [Computation Constant/Other Constraint] as described in [Reference]. While [Variation 1] performs [Result Comparison], quality also drops off with [Limitation].

In Table [X] rows (B), we observed that [Observation About Variation]. This suggests that [Insight About Model Behavior]. Furthermore, we observed in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, [Findings] and [Impact of Regularization]. In row (E) we [Another Variation or Model Component Change] and observed [Results Compared to Base Model].

\subsection{[Another Task]}

To evaluate if the [Model Type] can generalize to other tasks, we performed experiments on [New Task]. This task presents specific challenges: [Describe Specific Challenges]. Furthermore, [Comparison to Other Models].

We trained a [Model Configuration] on the [Dataset/Corpus Description], approximately [Number of Sentences]. We also trained it in [Training Configuration], using [Additional Data/Corpus Information]. We used a vocabulary of [Token Count] for [Description].

We performed a small number of experiments to select the [Hyperparameters] on the [Validation Set], while all other parameters remained unchanged from the [Previous Model Description]. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to [New Output Length]. We used [Search Method] with a beam size of [X] and $\alpha = [Y]$ for both settings.

Our results in Table [X] show that despite [Lack of Specific Tuning/Adaptation], our model performs [Results Compared to Previous Models], outperforming [Specific Model or Approach] even when training only on [Data Limitations].

In contrast to [Comparison Model Type], the [Model Name] outperforms [Alternative Model] even when trained only on [Data Description].
