\section{EXPERIMENTS}

We test our model in a number of experiments: [multiple sentences briefly describing the different experiments conducted, including key objectives and methodologies].

\subsection{DATASETS}

We closely follow the experimental setup in [reference]. Dataset statistics are summarized in Table [number]. In [dataset description], [explain the nature of the data and its structure]. [Describe any relevant statistics or features of the dataset].

Dataset   & Type             & Nodes   & Edges   &   Classes & Features   & Label rate   \\

[Dataset 1]  & [Type]  & [Nodes count]  & [Edges count]  & [Classes] & [Features count]  & [Label rate]  \\

[Dataset 2]  & [Type]  & [Nodes count]  & [Edges count]  & [Classes] & [Features count]  & [Label rate]  \\

\subsection{EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP}

Unless otherwise noted, we [describe the model setup, including architecture and evaluation metrics]. We provide additional experiments [mention any additional experimental setups used]. The [mention any dataset splits or preprocessing techniques used].

For the [mention specific experiment type], we [details about hyperparameter optimization and training techniques used]. We [explain training conditions such as epoch limits, optimizers, and early stopping criteria]. [Provide any initialization or normalization techniques used, if applicable].

\subsection{BASELINES}

We compare against the same baseline methods as in [reference]. Specifically, we include [describe the baseline methods being compared]. [Explain the rationale for excluding any methods, if applicable].

We further compare against [describe any additional comparison methods]. [Provide details on how these methods were trained or tested, and discuss their relevance to the current study].

Finally, we compare against [mention any additional models or previous works], ensuring to choose the best-performing variant based on [criteria or setups used].
