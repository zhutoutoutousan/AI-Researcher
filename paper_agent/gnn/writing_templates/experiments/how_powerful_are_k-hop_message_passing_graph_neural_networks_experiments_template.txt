\section{Experiments}

In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of [module name]. Specifically, we [describe the objectives/evaluation metrics/goals].

\subsection{Datasets}
To evaluate [purpose of the evaluation], we choose the following datasets: 
1) [Dataset 1 description and purpose]
2) [Dataset 2 description and purpose]
3) [Dataset 3 description and purpose]
[Include additional datasets as necessary]

\subsection{Empirical Evaluation}
We conduct [type of evaluation, e.g., ablation study, comparative study] to assess the performance of [module name] against [other methods/approaches]. The results are shown in Table~[X]. Based on the results, we conclude that [summarize key conclusions].

\subsection{Effectiveness on [specific tasks]}
To evaluate the effectiveness of [module name] on [task description], we compare our method with several existing models. For the baseline model, we utilize [baseline model description]. The results are displayed in Table~[Y]. We observe that [summarize findings].

\subsection{Evaluation on [specific datasets or tasks]}
For baseline models, we select: 
1) [Description of baseline model 1]
2) [Description of baseline model 2]
3) [Description of baseline model 3]
The results are shown in Table~[Z]. We note that [summarize findings].

\subsection{Running Time Comparison}
In this subsection, we compare the running time of [module name] to [other models or methods]. We use [base model] for this comparison. The results are summarized in Table~[A]. We find that [discuss findings related to running time].
