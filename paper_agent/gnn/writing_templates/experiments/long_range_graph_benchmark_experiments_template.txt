\section{Experiments and Discussion}

\subsection{Baseline Experiments}

We conduct baseline experiments on our proposed [dataset name] by training and evaluating [number] [model types] including [model type 1], and [model type 2]. We adopt fair and rigorous experimental settings for all our experiments in order to ensure reliable comparison between the [model types]. The former models do not directly include [specific mechanism or feature], while the latter are designed to [feature of the latter models]. For the baselines, we select [model names or classes] from [specific model type/class], and [model names or classes] from [another model type/class]. In order to facilitate fair comparison and reliable discussion of the observed trends, we choose hyperparameters while keeping to a budget of [parameter limit]. Detailed experimental setup and hyperparameters are provided in [reference to appendix or separate section].

\subsection{Results and Analysis}

The baseline results for [task name] are reported in Table [number]. Our aim is to address the following main questions through the analysis of these results:

\begin{itemize}
  \item (i) [Research question 1]
  \item (ii) [Research question 2]
\end{itemize}

[Discussion of the results, including observations, comparisons, and insights into the performance of different models. Include references to tables or figures as necessary.]

[Discussion on distinguishing performance trends among models, addressing underfitting or overfitting concerns.]

[Discussion on key model performances or characteristics that explain observed results, including any relevant theoretical connections.]

[Discussion on LRI characterizing factors, explaining how specific dataset characteristics inform model performance.]

\subsection{Challenges and Future Directions}

First, we note that [specific observation about model performance]. Such results motivate further exploration of [future research directions or potential models to investigate].

Second, the current limitations of [model type] suggest that [future improvement areas]. We believe that this highlights the need for [advancements or changes in approach].

Finally, we foresee challenges in scaling models like [specific models] to [size or complexity of the datasets]. Research in [specific techniques or methods] will be crucial as we pursue more efficient models for [specific applications or areas].
