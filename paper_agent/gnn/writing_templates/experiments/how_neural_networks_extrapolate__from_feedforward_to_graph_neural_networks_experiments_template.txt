\section{Experiments}

In this section, we describe the model, data, and training details for reproducing our experiments. Our experiments support all of our theoretical claims and insights.

\subsection{Overview}
We classify our experiments into the following major categories, each of which includes several ablation studies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [1)] Learning tasks where the target functions are [description of target functions], with [model type] with a wide range of hyperparameters. This validates [theoretical claims or insights].
    
    \item [2)] [Description of computation tasks or metrics] to validate [specific theorem or claim]. This shows [important findings].

    \item [3)] Learning tasks where the target functions are [description of linear functions]. These validate [theorems or lemmas], i.e., [specific findings related to the task]. This section includes [number] ablation studies:
    \begin{itemize}

        \item [b)] [Detailed description of the second ablation study].
        \item [c)] [Detailed description of the third ablation study].
    \end{itemize}

    \item [4)] [Additional tasks or experiments with different models or architectures].
    
    \item [5)] [Description of a different experiment related to a specific architecture or model].
    
    \item [6)] [Another task with distinct objectives, providing specific details of the learning problem].
    
    \item [7)] [Description of experiments addressing physical or real-world problems, detailing different extrapolation regimes].
