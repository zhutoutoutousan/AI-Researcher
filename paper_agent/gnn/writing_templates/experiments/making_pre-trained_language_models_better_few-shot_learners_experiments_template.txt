\section{Experiments}

We present our main results and address several research questions pertaining to our [Approach Name]. Implementation details are in [Appendix Reference].

\subsection{Main Results}

We use [model name] and set \( K = [value] \) in our experiments. A comparison of using [model A] vs [model B] can be found in [Appendix Reference]. For [specific task], in our main table, we report [specific method descriptors] only (which consistently performs the best, see Table [number]). To put our results in perspective, we compare to a number of baselines, namely: 
1. [Baseline Description 1]
2. [Baseline Description 2]
3. [Baseline Description 3]
4. [Baseline Description 4]
5. [Baseline Description 5]

\textbf{Single-prompt results.} Table [number] shows our main results using a single prompt, either from our [source] or the best generated ones. First, [description of initial findings regarding performance]. Also, [another observation about comparative performance]. 

\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{[Table title]}
\label{tab:example}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Method  & [Metric 1] & [Metric 2] \\ \hline
[Method 1] & [Result 1] & [Result 2] \\
[Method 2] & [Result 1] & [Result 2] \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Second, [further findings about performance comparisons]. Overall, our [descriptive summary of contributions] achieves [quantifiable gain] compared to [another method].

\subsection{Analysis of Generated Prompts}

Table [number] provides the results of using [comparison of conditions]. For [specific method], we compare [method variants] in which we start from [base comparison], apply [method], and then [further method]. In most cases, [results summary regarding performance]. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{[Table title]}
\label{tab:example2}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Condition  & [Metric 1] & [Metric 2] & [Metric 3] \\ \hline
[Condition 1] & [Result 1] & [Result 2] & [Result 3] \\
[Condition 2] & [Result 1] & [Result 2] & [Result 3] \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Analysis of Demonstration Sampling}

Table [number] compares the performance of demonstrations using [sampling methods]. We acknowledge that [context about specific limits] but find that in either case, [key finding about the effectiveness of a method].

\subsection{Sample Efficiency}

Figure [number] illustrates how [description of comparison] compares as \( K \) increases. For [specific task], despite using only [number of examples], [description of findings]. On the harder task of [another task], [performance trends].
