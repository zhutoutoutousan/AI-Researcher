\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. Our method provides a solution for [specific application/field] by [brief description of the approach]. 

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}
The input to [specific model/type] is usually represented as [input structure], where [describe components of the structure]. The [target model] learns to [describe goal] under the supervision of [specific tasks]. However, [explain challenges faced, and why they necessitate your approach]. 

To address [challenge], our problem concerns the learning of a [type of model] from [data context] without [specific labels or data]. Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
\text{[insert mathematical definition]}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Proposed Framework}
Recent advances in [relevant field/technique] have shown [general observation from literature]. Inspired by this, we propose [Framework name], which [describe how it works at a high level].

Formally, given an input [data/graph type] and a [model description], we model the likelihood [define likelihood function]:
\begin{equation}
p([data]; \theta) = [describe likelihood function].
\end{equation}

The primary question becomes how to [explain the key question regarding modeling the likelihood].

\subsection{Components of the Method}
To compute [specific component of the model], one naive solution could be [describe naive approach]. However, this approach overlooks [explain flaws/limitations]. 

To address this issue, we present [new method/approach], which emphasizes [describe key concept or innovation]. Specifically, we define [variable/term] as follows:
\begin{equation}
\text{[insert additional mathematical definition]}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
For computational efficiency, we propose to [briefly explain strategy]. Additionally, [discuss related considerations for implementation]. We describe how to [step-by-step explanation of the implementation]. 

For [Component A], we denote its decoder as [Decoder A description], which [explain what the decoder does]. In contrast, for [Component B], we model the likelihood as follows:
\begin{equation}
\text{[mathematical expression for Component B]}
\end{equation}

Next, we define [performance metric or loss function] as:
\begin{equation}
L = [insert loss function expression].
\end{equation}

\subsection{Applications to [Specific Area]}
In this section, we discuss how to apply [Framework name] to [specific application/area], which can be beneficial for [explain significance]. 

[Briefly discuss uniqueness of handling different types of data/models in this context.]

To ensure proper functioning, we propose [specific strategies for subgroups or heterogeneous models], and we provide [methodology for handling large-scale data under constraints].

\subsection{Conclusion}
In summary, we have proposed [restate main idea], establishing [importance of the proposed method]. Future work will explore [potential future directions or enhancements to the approach].
