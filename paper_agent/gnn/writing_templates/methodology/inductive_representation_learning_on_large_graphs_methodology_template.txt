\section{Proposed Method: [Module Name]}

The key idea behind our approach is that we [explain the core motivation behind the proposed method]. Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [specific challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Component 1]}

In this section, we describe [component name], which [explain the purpose and functionality of the component]. In particular, we assume that we have [describe necessary conditions or assumptions]. We provide a detailed workflow of the [component name] as follows: 

\begin{algorithm}[ht]
\caption{[Title of Algorithm 1]}
\KwIn{[Input Description]}
\KwOut{[Output Description]}
[Algorithm Steps]
\end{algorithm}

The intuition behind the [component name] is that [explain the underlying intuition behind the algorithm]. Each step in the algorithm proceeds as follows: [describe the detailed procedure of the algorithm]. 

To generalize this algorithm, we [discuss adaptations or extensions to be made for different scenarios or datasets].

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Component 2]}

To learn the parameters of [module name], we apply [specific method or technique] to [output representations]. In this section, we define the loss function that [describe the purpose and expected outcome of the loss function]:

\begin{equation}
    J = [mathematical formulation]
\end{equation}

where [explain each variable and parameter in the equation]. 

This approach allows [describe any additional benefits or implications of this methodology].

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Component 3]}

Unlike [comparison to existing approaches], our method focuses on [specific characteristics of your approach]. Specifically, we examined [different options or architectures], which include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [First option]: [Description of first option]
    \item [Second option]: [Description of second option]
    \item [Third option]: [Description of third option]
\end{itemize}

Each aggregator function [explain the purpose and the properties]. We found that [summarize key findings or conclusions drawn from your experiments or comparisons]. 

In conclusion, the proposed [module name] provides a novel approach to [describe what challenges it addresses and its broader impact].
