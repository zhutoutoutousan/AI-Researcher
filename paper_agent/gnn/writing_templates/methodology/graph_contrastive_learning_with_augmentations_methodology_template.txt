\subsection{[First Subsection Title]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method, referencing relevant literature.]

We focus on [specific focus area or application]. Given a [specific data structure] $X \in \{X_{m} : m \in M\}$ in the dataset of $M$ units, we formulate the transformation $\hat{X}$ satisfying: $\hat{X} \sim q(\hat{X}|X)$, where $q(\cdot|X)$ is [description of distribution and its significance]. For example, [example from a related domain].

When it comes to [specific challenge], one challenge is [description of the challenge]. In other words, for [different categories or domains], [explanation of varying requirements]. We mainly focus on [categories or domains of interest]. Next, we propose [number] general strategies for [focus area] and discuss the intuitive priors that they introduce.

\subsection{[Second Subsection Title]}

Motivated by [relevant motivation], we propose a [title of the proposed framework or method] for [specific application]. In [specific domain], [description of the objective].

The framework consists of the following [number] major components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [(1)] [Component 1 description, detailing its role and significance.]
    \item [(2)] [Component 2 description, detailing its role and significance.]
    \item [(3)] [Component 3 description, detailing its role and significance.]
    \item [(4)] [Component 4 description, detailing its role and significance.]
\end{itemize}

[Description of the processing, workflow, or logic between the components, including any interim results.]

Denote [relevant notation] as $sim(z_{n,i}, z_{n,j}) = \frac{z^{T}_{n,i} z_{n,j}}{\| z_{n,i} \| \| z_{n,j} \|}$, so that [mathematical formulation or necessary equations]. 

The final [objective or result] is defined across all [context]. The proposed [method or framework] is summarized in [appendix, section, or reference].

[Personal discussion about implications or theoretical contributions, including references to existing research.]

Furthermore, we [draw connections, compare with other approaches, or describe limitations]. The proposed [method or framework] can also be instantiated as [description of variants or related methods].
