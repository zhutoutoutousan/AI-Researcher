\section{[Section Title]}

In this section, we study [main topic or concept], focusing on [specific aspects]. We show that [brief summary of findings or claims]. In Section [number], we [describe what will be done or analyzed].

\subsection{[Subsection Title]}

Here we study [specific aspect or method], focusing on [describe focus]. Recall that [important relation or background information]. 

We begin by showing that [first key result or finding]. This is in contrast to [related work or standard result].

\begin{proposition}[Title of Proposition] 
The [concept or relation] is as follows:
\[
[Mathematical formulation of the key result]
\]
\end{proposition}

[Context or explanation related to the proposition]. We now show that [additional results or clarifications]. 

\begin{proposition}[Title of Proposition] 
We have the following properties:
1. [First property and relevant equation]
2. [Second property and relevant equation]
3. [Third property and relevant equation]
\end{proposition}

[Context or further explanations regarding the properties]. We use [reference or technique] to demonstrate [further implications of the results].

\subsection{[Next Subsection Title]}

In the previous section, we found that [summary of previous results]. We now [describe what this section will show or explain]. 

The next proposition provides [specific results or formulation]:
\begin{proposition}[Title of Proposition]
For any [conditions], we have the following:
\[
[Mathematical formulation of the result]
\]
\end{proposition}

[Further details regarding the proposition, possibly introducing related concepts]. [Contextual elaboration, possibly including comparative analysis with previous work].

\begin{corollary}[Title of Corollary]
Let [conditions]. Then [statement of the corollary].
\end{corollary}

[Explanation of the corollary, discussing implications and comparing against other results]. 

\subsection{[Final Subsection Title]}

In this section, we examine [topic or concept related to the subsection]. Following the derivation from [previous section or relevant work], we define [key definitions or concepts]. 

We then have the following result:

\begin{proposition}[Title of Proposition]
Assume that [conditions]. Then, we have:
\[
[Mathematical formulation of the result]
\]
\end{proposition}

[Additional context, applications, or limitations related to the result]. 

Finally, we summarize [key findings and implications]. 

\section{[Next Major Section Title]}
