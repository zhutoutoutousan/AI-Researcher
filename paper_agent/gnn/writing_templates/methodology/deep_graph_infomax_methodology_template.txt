\section{Methodology}

In this section, we will present the [Method Name] method in a top-down fashion: starting with an abstract overview of our specific [learning setup/approach], followed by an exposition of the objective function optimized by our method, and concluding by enumerating all the steps of our procedure in a [specific setting/experimental framework].

\subsection{Overview of [Learning Approach]}

We assume a generic [specific setup/field]: we are provided with [data type/structure], [data notation], where [N] is the number of [elements/instances] and [element notation] ∈ [Feature Space] represents the features of [element type]. We are also provided with [additional information/context] in the form of [data structure/format].

Our objective is to learn an [encoder type], [Encoder Function]: [Input Type] → [Output Type], such that [Output Equation] represents [description of output]. These representations may then be utilized for [specific downstream tasks].

Here we will focus on [specific encoding/architecture type], which generates [representations/outputs] by [description of process]. A key consequence is that the produced [output type] summarize [context/area of focus].

\subsection{[Key Concept/Technique]}

Our approach to learning the [component] relies on [descriptive strategy/goal] - that is, we seek to [explain purpose of method]. 

In order to obtain [specific representations], we leverage a [function/type] and use it to summarize [previous outputs] into a [desired output]; i.e., [Summarization Equation].

As a means of [objective purpose], we employ a [function/strategy] such that [Description of Functionality].

Negative samples for [function] are provided by [description of sampling method]. In a [context setting], such samples may be obtained as [explanation of dataset]. 

For the objective, we follow the intuitions from [Previous Work] and use a [type of objective] with a [loss type] loss between the samples from [positive set] and [negative set]. Following their work, we use the following objective:

\begin{equation}
L = [Equation of Objective]
\end{equation}

This approach effectively [describe what is achieved through the objective]. 

\subsection{Theoretical Motivation}

We now provide some intuition that connects [specific outcome] of our [component] to [related principle/concept].

\textbf{Lemma 1.} Let [Notation] be a set of [data type] drawn from [probability distribution] such that [condition]. Let [Function] be [function description] and [Output Notation] be the output of [function]. The optimal classifier between [joint distribution] and [product of marginals] has an error rate upper bounded by [Bound Expression].

\textbf{Proof.} [Proof details and logical steps].

This motivates our use of [specific process] and using [loss type] loss to optimize this classifier is well-understood in the context of [related field/application].

\subsection{Overview of [Method/Procedure]}

Assuming the [context setting], we will now summarize the steps of the [Method Name] procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Step 1: description of action taken]
    \item [Step 2: description of action taken]
    \item [Step 3: description of action taken]
    \item [Step 4: description of action taken]
    \item [Step 5: description of action taken]
\end{enumerate}

This algorithm is fully summarized by [reference to visual aids, if any].
