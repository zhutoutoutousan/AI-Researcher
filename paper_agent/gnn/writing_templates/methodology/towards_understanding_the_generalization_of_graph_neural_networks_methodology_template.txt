\section{Theoretical Results}

In this section, we first present [a brief overview of the theoretical contributions] in Section \ref{sec:results_overview}. After that, we turn to [specific examples, case studies, or applications] in Section \ref{sec:case_studies}. Please refer to the Appendix for [relevant proofs, additional details, or supplementary information].

\subsection{General Results of [Key Method or Concept]}\label{sec:results_overview}

We first analyze [key properties or characteristics of the proposed method/concept] and provide the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}[Informal] 
Suppose [necessary assumptions or conditions] hold. Denote by [concept or model name], for any [variable definitions], the objective [objective function] satisfies

\begin{equation}
| [function] | \leq L \cdot [condition],
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\| [gradient or term] \| \leq P \cdot \max\{\| [term] \|^{\tilde{\alpha}}, \| [term] \| \},
\end{equation}

with constants \(L\) and \(P\).

\begin{remark}
We provide more detailed analysis of \(L\) and \(P\) in Section \ref{sec:case_studies}. Both \(L\) and \(P\) depend on [describe dependencies]. Thus, the [key theoretical bounds or results] vary by [context or conditions].
\end{remark}

Our first main result is [description of the primary theoretical result], as presented in Theorem \ref{thm:main_result}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main_result}
Suppose [necessary assumptions] hold. Suppose that [conditions regarding learning rates or other relevant variables]. For any [conditions on variables], with probability [specified probability],

(a). If [condition on variable] , we have

\[
[Mathematical formulation or statement].
\]

(b). If [condition], we have

\[
[Mathematical formulation or statement].
\]

(c). If [condition], we have

\[
[Mathematical formulation or statement].
\]

\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
Theorem \ref{thm:main_result} shows that [explanation of results]. Generally, our upper bounds are of order [describe the order], which is [comparison with prior work]. Note that with the increase of [variable], the [comparison with previous findings]. Our results address these drawbacks and provide [insights or guarantees].
\end{remark}

Our second main result is [description of the secondary theoretical result].

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:secondary_result}
Suppose [necessary assumptions] hold. For any [conditions on variables], with probability [specified probability],

(a). If [condition], we have

\[
\|[term]\| = O(L \cdot [expression]).
\]

(b). If [condition], we have

\[
\|[term]\| = O(L \cdot [expression]).
\]

(c). If [condition], we have

\[
\|[term]\| = O(L \cdot [expression]).
\]

\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
Theorem \ref{thm:secondary_result} provides [description of the result]. Overall, the [key takeaway or insight].
\end{remark}

\subsection{Case Study of [Key Methods or Models]}\label{sec:case_studies}

We have established [general results] in Theorem \ref{thm:main_result}. In this part, we analyze [context or constants affecting the results], with the aim of [what the analysis achieves]. [Describe the methods or models selected for analysis]. 

[For each selected model/method, follow the below structure:]

\subsubsection{[Model/Method Name]}

The work [citation] proposes [brief description of the method]. The key process is

\[
[Y = f(A, X, W) \text{ where } A = [\text{description}], X = [\text{description}], W = [\text{description}]]
\]

\begin{proposition}
Suppose [necessary assumptions] hold, then the objective [function details]. Specifically, [details on dependency or characteristics].
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
[Describe findings or implications based on the proposition].
\end{remark}

[Continue similarly for each method/model]

To summarize, [describe overarching findings or implications]. Again, we emphasize that [closing thoughts or future work].
