\section{Approach}

Our basic approach, inspired by [previous work/technique], is characterized by [describe the key aspects of the approach, including any relevant scaling or methodological variations]. Specifically, we systematically explore different settings to address [challenge]. Our method consists of [number] main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

\subsection{Motivation}
[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

\subsection{Workflow}
[A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Approaches}
[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Detailed explanation of each term in the equation]
    \item [Further explanation, if necessary]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model and Architectures}
We utilize [model name/architecture] as described in [reference]. To assess the impact of [aspect] on performance, we [describe the variations in models and sizes]. Our approach allows us to validate the [theoretical/empirical principles].

Further details on model specifications are documented in the appendix.

\subsection{Training Dataset}
To construct our training dataset, we [explain the process of data collection and preparation]. This includes [considerations for dataset quality, diversity, and cleaning processes].

\subsection{Training Process}
According to [reference], it has been established that [provide insight into training considerations]. Hence, we [describe the training process and hyperparameter settings], as outlined in Table [label]. Additional training details can be found in the appendix.

\subsection{Evaluation}
For evaluation, we [explain the evaluation process, including any adaptations made]. On tasks requiring [specific requirement], we employ [describe technique used for evaluation]. 

Final results are reported on [indicate source of results] for each [model size/learning setting] when available, and we clarify how we handle [any particular evaluation challenges].
