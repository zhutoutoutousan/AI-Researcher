\section{[Title of the Section]}

The main technical challenge in [describe the main challenge relevant to the research domain] is [explain the difficulty]. [Explain briefly about current limitations or issues being faced].

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [specific challenge]. Our method employs [key elements or techniques], which [describe advantages, e.g., reduces memory consumption, minimizes numerical error, etc.].

Consider optimizing [describe the objective function or concept] given [describe input or necessary condition]:

\begin{equation}
[Insert equation representing the objective function]
\end{equation}

To optimize [objective function], we require [describe necessary derivatives or gradients]. The first step is to determine how the gradient of the [objective function] depends on [key variable]. This can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Formal definition of the key concept]
\end{equation}

We can compute [necessary quantity] by [explain computational steps, methods, or approaches used]. However, [describe any complication or additional requirement of the process]. To resolve this, we can [explain alternative strategy or approach].

The gradients require evaluating [describe necessary derivatives and their relationship, if applicable]:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Describe how these mathematical formulations can be computed efficiently or any alternative methods used].

[Add any necessary explanations regarding algorithm functionality or context].

Most [relevant type of solvers/methods] have the option to [describe capabilities or features], and when the [outcome] depends on these [intermediate results], [explain any required procedures or steps to achieve desired results].

The results presented here extend those of [cite previous work] by offering [briefly outline what is extended or improved]. [Refer to any appendices or supplementary information as needed].
