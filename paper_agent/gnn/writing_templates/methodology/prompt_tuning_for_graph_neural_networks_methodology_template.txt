Let [define the main concept] represent [specific description], where [list relevant components]. The features can be denoted as [explain the feature representation], where [more details]. It is important to note that there are various types of [relevant tasks], including [list examples]. Our work primarily focuses on the [specific task].

[Introduction to pre-trained models or relevant background knowledge]. With the dataset [Dataset Name] and the loss function [Loss Function], we obtain a pre-trained [Model Type] by minimizing the pre-training loss as follows:

\label{sec:method_description}

[Name of the method] draws inspiration from [source of inspiration], allowing us to [describe the core mechanism]. Given a [describe what is given], our goal is to obtain [target outcome]. The transformation [specify transformation] operates on [specify what happens], which can be formulated as:
