\section{[Title of Your Proposed Method]}

In this section, we propose [Method Name] based on [briefly describe the insights or background]. Our [Method Name] contributes [list two or more key advantages]. First, [describe the first advantage or feature]. Second, [describe the second advantage or feature]. The mathematical expression of [Concept] is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Insert mathematical expression here]
\end{equation}

where [define any variables or terms used in the equation]. [Additional brief explanation of each term in the equation].

An illustration of our proposed [Method Name] is provided in Figure [Figure Number]. There are [number] main steps in [Method Name]: [Step 1], [Step 2], and [Step 3]. We first utilize [describe the first processing step]. Theoretically, [mention any theoretical foundation or support for this step]. After [Step 1], a [describe the next processing step] is applied to [describe the purpose of this step]. [Explain the structure or process captured in this step, including any relevant tree or depth information]. However, [discuss challenges or considerations specific to this step, if any]. Furthermore, [discuss additional considerations regarding the input or node specifics involved].

To this end, we introduce [describe the additional mechanism or adjustment]. We utilize [describe any additional tools or techniques] that are shared by [clarify application among nodes or components]. These [scores/tools] [explain their purpose and how they are determined]. Utilizing this [additional mechanism], [Method Name] can [explain the overall capability or outcome of this adjustment]. 

[Discuss the efficiency or advantages of your method regarding the defined steps. Mention how parameters are considered and any training process details].

Note that [discuss any structural details regarding the end model or classifier used]. In our [Method Name], [explain how the final output/results are derived]. Thus, the [relevant loss function or objective] can be calculated as follows:
