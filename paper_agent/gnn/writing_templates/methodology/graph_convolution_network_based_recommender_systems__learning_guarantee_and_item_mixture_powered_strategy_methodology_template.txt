\section{Generalization for [Method/Model]}

We first investigate the model complexity of [Method/Model] via [Complexity Measurement] in Section 3.1. Then we link [Connection/Relationship] and [Outcome] for [Learning Type/Task] in Section 3.2, which finally yield [Result/Conclusion].

\subsection{Assumptions}
To establish the generalization guarantee, we propose some mild assumptions that are easy to implement. For the loss function, we assume [Loss Function Description]. For the [Component], we assume [Assumption on Component]. For the weight matrices, we assume [Assumptions on Weight Matrices]. For the input feature, we assume [Assumption on Input Features].

\subsection{Covering Number for [Method/Model]}

In classical learning theory, the complexity of function class is closely related to the generalization ability, and the typical complexity measurements are [Measurement 1] and [Measurement 2]. In this paper, we adopt the [Complexity Measure] to investigate the model complexity of [Method/Model]. Based on the properties of [Relevant Properties/Structures], we study the complexity by combining the recommendations of [Method/Model] for [User-Item Interface].

\begin{lemma}[Covering number bound]
Under Assumptions, we further assume that [Conditions]. Given a sample set S with size n, the covering number of F over S with specific $\epsilon$ is bounded as 

\[
\text{log } N^{(}F_{|S}, \epsilon, \| \cdot \|_{\infty}) \leq [Mathematical Expression].
\]

Moreover, when $\epsilon \leq [Condition]$, 

\[
\text{log } N^{(}F_{|S}, \epsilon, \| \cdot \|_{\infty}) \leq [Alternative Mathematical Expression],
\]
where [Definition of Terms].
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
The key idea of the proof is to exploit [Key Concept]. To investigate the complexity of [Task/Recommendation] generated by [Method/Model], we establish the connection between [Concept 1] and [Concept 2]. Here [Variable] describes the [Relevance] for the following generalization analysis. According to [Norm Bound Condition], the assumption can be naturally satisfied when [Condition]. [Further Explanation].
\end{remark}

\subsection{Generalization Bound for [Learning Types]}

[Learning Type 1] and [Learning Type 2] are both commonly used in [Context]. The primary difference between these two settings is [Comparison of Settings]. In the following, we first relate the generalization error for two settings to the covering number of [Method/Model] recommendations, then derive the final generalization guarantees using [Lemma Reference].

\subsubsection{[Learning Type 1]}
Let [Variable} to be [Description], we assume that [Assumption Statement]. Under this [Learning Type 1] setting, the empirical error over the training set [Set Variable] is defined as follows,

\textbf{Empirical error:}

\textbf{Generalization error:}

\[
\hat{L}_{m}(f) = [Mathematical Expression]
\]

Under [Learning Type 1], we can derive the following generalization error bound:

\begin{lemma}
Let F be a [Function Class Description]. Under assumptions, for any function f in class F, with probability of at least [Probability] over [Sample Type], we have

\[
L(f) \leq \hat{L}_{m}(f) + [Mathematical Expression].
\]

\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{[Learning Type 2]}
For the [Learning Type 2] setting, the [Example of Full Samples]. The goal of [Learning Type 2] is to predict [Prediction Goal]. Under this setting, the formulation of empirical error $\hat{L}_{m}(f)$ is similar to [Reference], and the generalization error is defined as follows,

\[
L_{u}(f) = [Mathematical Expression].
\]

Following the same strategy adopted in proving [Previous Lemma], we again need to perform a generalization bound under [Learning Type 2] via covering number of function class. As shown above, the generalization and empirical error under [Learning Type 2] do not depend on [Condition]. [Explanation of Differences].

\begin{lemma}
Let F be a [Function Class] and assume that [Assumption]. Under assumptions, for any function f in class F, with probability of at least [Probability] over [Conditions], we have

\[
L_{u}(f) \leq \hat{L}_{m}(f) + [Mathematical Expression].
\]

\end{lemma}

Armed with [Reference to Lemmas], we now present the generalization error bounds for [Learning Type 1] and [Learning Type 2].

\begin{proposition}[Generalization Bound]
Under assumptions, for any function f in class F, in [Learning Type 1], with probability of at least [Probability], we have,

\[
L(f) \leq \hat{L}_{m}(f) + [Mathematical Expression].
\]

Accordingly, in [Learning Type 2], with probability of at least [Probability], we have,

\[
L_{u}(f) \leq \hat{L}_{m}(f) + [Mathematical Expression].
\]

\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
[Key Finding]. We first discuss [General Discussion on Dependency]. The most important term is [Variable Relation], which depends on [Conditions]. A natural idea is to [Natural Idea]. The subsequent discussions focus on [Focus Areas].
\end{remark}

\subsection{Role of [Concept]}

It is easy to see that [Description of Concept]. Therefore, fixed other terms in [Variable], the bound grows as [Growth Rate]. For [Specific Cases], [Concept Description].

\subsection{Role of [Another Concept]}

As pointed above, the [Effect on Generalization]. The [Key Variable] presents [Observation]. For the [Condition], while [Explanation], [Additional Insights]. Therefore, this generalization bound provides [Outcome/Conclusion].
