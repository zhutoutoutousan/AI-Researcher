\section{Abstract}

Low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large graphs have proved extremely useful in a variety of prediction tasks, such as [insert examples of tasks]. However, most existing approaches [describe the limitation of previous methods, e.g., "require that all nodes in the graph are present during training" or "are inherently transductive"]. To address this challenge, we propose [insert module name], a [describe the nature of the framework, e.g., "general inductive framework" or "novel approach"] that [briefly explain how the new method overcomes the limitation, e.g., "leverages node feature information"]. 

Our method consists of [number] main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Formally, we define [insert concept] as follows: 

\begin{equation}
    [Insert mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Provide a few sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method, emphasizing its novelty and effectiveness].

Specifically, [a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module, including steps and processes involved in generating embeddings]. 

Furthermore, we [insert comparative analysis, e.g., "compare our method with existing approaches"], highlighting [mention key differences or advantages].

We validate our approach by [describe the experimental setup, including benchmarks or datasets used]. Our results show that [insert summary of findings, e.g., "our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on..."].

In summary, [concisely wrap up the contribution and significance of the proposed method].
