\section*{Abstract}

\noindent Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge] in [domain/area]. [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. Specifically, we [describe the methodology briefly, including any significant improvements or novel aspects]. 

\noindent Our method consists of [number] main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

\noindent We evaluate our approach on [list datasets/tasks] and report [key findings/results]. In particular, [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. 

\noindent Formally, we define [concept] as follows: 

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

\noindent where [detailed explanation of each term in the equations]. Furthermore, we identify [specific observations or areas for future research].
