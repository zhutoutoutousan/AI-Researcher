\section*{Abstract}
[Begin with a sentence introducing the main topic, highlighting the significance of the field and its current state of research. Example: "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are [general description of the research area]."]

[Follow with a statement about the existing gap or challenge in the field. Example: "Despite [current achievements], [specific challenge or gap in understanding] remains [state relevance]."]

[Inspired by previous work, we propose [module name/approach] to address [specific challenge or gap].]

[To tackle this challenge, our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].]

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

[Formally, we define [concept] as follows:]
\begin{equation}
[Insert mathematical formulation of the key components here]
\end{equation}

[Several sentences detailing the effects of different components or terms in the equations.]

[Following the theoretical exposition, discuss experimental or empirical validation. Example: "Experimental results on [specific datasets] demonstrate [findings], reinforcing the theoretical insights."]

[Conclude with a sentence or two summarizing the implications of the findings. Example: "Our findings provide new insights into [specific outcome or future direction of research]."]
