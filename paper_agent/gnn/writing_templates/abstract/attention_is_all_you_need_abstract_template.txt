\section*{Abstract}

The dominant [field/area of research] is largely reliant on [existing methods/approaches], which typically involve [brief description of methods]. The [best-performing method/type of model] incorporates [specific feature/technique] to [address/find solutions to] [specific challenge]. Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge].

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Specifically, [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].

Furthermore, we detail the workflow of the module, which can be summarized as follows: [a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

We compare our proposed method with existing approaches, indicating that [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. 

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

In this equation, we explain each term in detail: [detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

Our findings are validated through experiments, demonstrating that [summary of experimental results and claims]. These results indicate that [further implications or applications of the results].
