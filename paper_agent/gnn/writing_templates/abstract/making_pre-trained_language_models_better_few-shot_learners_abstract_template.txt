\section{Abstract}

The recent [previous model/technique] achieves remarkable [performance metric] solely by leveraging [input type] and [context type]. Inspired by their findings, we study [research focus] in a more practical scenario, where we utilize [alternative method/strategy] that is [adjective: e.g., computationally efficient, simpler, etc.]. We present [module name]—[short definition of the module]—a suite of [adjective: e.g., simple, effective, etc.] and complementary techniques for [main goal]. Our approach includes (1) [component 1] together with [description of additional element], and (2) [component 2] which [describe function]. Finally, we present a [type of evaluation] for analyzing [evaluation focus] on a range of [application areas], including [application 1] and [application 2]. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods [action taken by methods] in this [setting description], achieving [quantitative result: e.g., improvement percentage] and [average result] across all tasks. Our approach makes minimal assumptions on [assumption aspects], hence constituting a strong [method type] method for [research focus].
