\section{Abstract}

[Start with a brief introduction to the field and highlight the importance of the specific technique/technology being discussed. Mention any relevant previous work.]

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

[Include several sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method. Discuss the limitations of existing approaches and how they motivate the new solution.]

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

[Provide a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module. Explain how each component contributes to the overall method and its objectives.]

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Insert mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Detailed explanation of each term in the equations should follow to clarify the mathematical representations.]

Furthermore, we provide a [theoretical/empirical] analysis of the above observation, which can serve as a [description/justification] of [specific issue]. 

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches should be included here.]

A set of experiments on [datasets or benchmarks] have confirmed our analysis and insights and demonstrated the superiority of our proposed methods.
