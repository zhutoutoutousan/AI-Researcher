\section*{Abstract}

State-of-the-art [domain-related systems/techniques] are heavily [characteristic], making the optimization algorithm a crucial ingredient for [goal]. A recent line of work has shown that in a certain [context/condition], the learning dynamics of [method] are governed by a certain [concept] obtained at [initialization point/condition], called the [name of the concept]. 

We study the [aspect] of learning in such a regime by analyzing this [concept] and the corresponding [related space]. In particular, we study [properties of interest], including [property 1] and [property 2], and compare to other known [related concepts] for similar [structures/methods].
