\section{Introduction}

[Begin with a general statement about the research area and its significance. Mention foundational techniques or concepts that guide the current work.]

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

[Provide multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method. Discuss the limitations of existing approaches and the gaps in current research.]

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

[Describe the detailed workflow of the module in a paragraph. Explain how each component contributes to addressing the challenge.]

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Provide a detailed explanation of each term in the equations above. Clarify the relevance of each term to the overall framework.]

Furthermore, [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches. Highlight the advantages of your approach and potential impacts on the field or practical applications.]

[Discuss potential challenges or unique considerations related to the implementation or theoretical understanding of your method.]

Contributions. In this paper, we present [briefly summarize the main contributions of the paper, using structured bullet points if necessary]. 
(i) [Contribution 1: Describe the first major contribution or finding.]
(ii) [Contribution 2: Describe the second major contribution or finding.]
(iii) [Contribution 3: Describe the third major contribution or finding.]
(iv) [Contribution 4: Describe an additional impact or result from the study that warrants mention.]

[Conclude the introduction with an overview of the paperâ€™s structure or outline, guiding the reader on what to expect in subsequent sections.]
