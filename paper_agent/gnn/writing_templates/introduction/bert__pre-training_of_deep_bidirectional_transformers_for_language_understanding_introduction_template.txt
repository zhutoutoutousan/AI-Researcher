\section{Introduction}

Language model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks \cite{ref1; ref2; ref3; ref4}. These include [briefly describe the types of tasks, such as sentence-level and token-level tasks, and their objectives].

There are [number] existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: [briefly describe the first approach] and [briefly describe the second approach]. [Explain how these approaches function, mentioning their shared objectives and any notable architectures or techniques].

We argue that current techniques [discuss limitations of existing methods, focusing on specific aspects of the challenge]. The major limitation is that [elaborate on the specific constraints or issues each technique faces, providing examples where applicable]. Such restrictions are [describe the impacts of these limitations on the tasks at hand].

In this paper, we improve the [specific type of approach] by proposing [module name]. [Briefly explain how the proposed method addresses the identified challenges, providing an intuition behind the solution]. The [describe any innovative techniques or objectives introduced in the method]. Unlike [reference existing methods], our approach [delineate how the proposed method differs and improves upon those methods].

The contributions of our paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [First contribution statement: succinctly outline primary finding or method that contrasts with existing works.]
    \item [Second contribution statement: explain how the new method simplifies or enhances existing architectures or approaches.]
    \item [Third contribution statement: list any advancements or outcomes that demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method.]
