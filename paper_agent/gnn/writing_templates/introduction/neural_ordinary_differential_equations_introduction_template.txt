\section{Introduction}

Models such as [model types/techniques], which [describe main function of models], build complicated transformations by composing a sequence of transformations to a hidden state:

\begin{equation}
h_{t+1} = h_{t} + f(h_{t}, \theta_{t}) \tag{1}
\end{equation}

where $t \in \{0 \ldots T\}$ and $h_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{D}$. These iterative updates can be seen as [explanation/conceptual framework].

What happens as we [challenge context]? In the limit, we parameterize [concept] using [framework/novel approach]:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d h(t)}{dt} = f(h(t), t, \theta) \tag{2}
\end{equation}

Starting from the input layer $h(0)$, we can define the output layer $h(T)$ to be [explanation of the output layer in relation to the proposed method]. This value can be computed by [explain solution approach or methodology used].

Defining and evaluating [subject] using [method/approach] has several benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{[Benefit 1]}: [Detailed explanation of benefit 1].
    \item \textbf{[Benefit 2]}: [Detailed explanation of benefit 2].
    \item \textbf{[Benefit 3]}: [Detailed explanation of benefit 3].
\end{itemize}

[Additional context or implications of proposed method]. In Section [number], we [brief overview of topics discussed in following sections].
