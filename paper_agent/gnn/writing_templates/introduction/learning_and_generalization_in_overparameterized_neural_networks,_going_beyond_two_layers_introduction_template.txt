\section{Introduction}

\noindent Neural network learning has become a key machine learning approach and has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of real-world domains, such as [domain 1], [domain 2], and [domain 3] \cite{ref1, ref2, ref3}. In contrast to the widely accepted empirical success, much less theory is known. Despite a recent boost of theoretical studies, many questions remain largely open, including fundamental ones about [key challenge 1] and [key challenge 2].

One key challenge in analyzing neural networks is that [describe the challenge related to the optimization]. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that [describe observed outcomes]. Therefore,

\textbf{what can neural networks provably learn?}

Another key challenge is that in practice, [describe the challenge related to overparameterization]. It is observed that [describe findings about overparameterization]. Therefore,

\textbf{why do overparameterized networks generalize?}

\subsection{What Can Neural Networks Provably Learn?}

Most existing works analyzing [topic of analysis] \cite{ref4, ref5, ref6} make [describe unrealistic assumptions about the data or the model]. Other works focusing on [related topic] \cite{ref7, ref8} shows that [summarize findings of other works].

[A theorem or concept that does not depend on certain assumptions] is often more desirable. Indeed, how to obtain a result that [describe desired result] lies in the center of [relevant theory] \cite{ref9}. Also, [explain the significance of studying certain activations].

[A study or finding] proves that [describe result]. This is a [type of result] because it makes [explain the assumptions made]. [Another study] proves that [describe result].

On a separate note, if one [describe an alternative view or approach], then [describe implications]. This result implies [describe consequences].

\textbf{Our Result.} We prove that [describe the main result of your research].

\textbf{Specifically,} suppose [describe assumptions about the best network]. We show that [describe what you are able to learn or achieve], using [describe the methods] of size greater than a fixed polynomial in [list parameters]. Furthermore, [describe additional findings related to complexity and sample size].

We stress here that this is [describe the type of learning] because [explain]. 

\textbf{Our Contributions.} We believe our result gives further insights into [describe the relevance of your work].

- \textbullet\ To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing that [describe unique contribution]. 
- \textbullet\ [Describe another significant contribution and its implications].
- \textbullet\ [Describe how the techniques or results of this work have been applied or could be beneficial].
- \textbullet\ [Explain the importance of findings related to optimization and accuracy].
- \textbullet\ [List the new tools or perspectives established by your work].

\subsection{Other Related Works.} We acknowledge a different line of research [describe related studies]. This is [explain how it differs from your approach].

There is also a line of work [describe another relevant area of research]. These works study [explain the focus of this research]. [Provide a comparison or contrast with your findings].

With sufficient [describe relevant condition], [cite previous work that relates to your topic]. These results do not cover [explain what is not relevant to your study].
