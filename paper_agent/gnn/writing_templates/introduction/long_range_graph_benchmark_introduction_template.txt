\section{Introduction}

Considering a [general concept or subject], there are numerous instances in [field or domain] where [describe the relevance/context of the problem]. This has led to a rising interest in the development of [specific technology or methodology] for [application].

The commonly used approach in this area is based on [name the paradigm or technique], where [describe the main process of this technique]. A system that incorporates [number of layers/components] can [describe the iterative process or other relevant details]. However, as [explain the challenge related to deeper layers or complex systems], this can result in [identify the issue that arises with this challenge].

To address [specified challenge], [previous work or approach] utilized [describe a method or technique] as a proposed solution. The rationale behind this approach is to [explain the intention or benefit of the new method]. Consequently, several recent works now focus on [briefly mention new developments or methods arising from this].

However, it is often the case that [describe limitations or observations on the existing approaches]. This observation is prevalent in [mention specific datasets or contexts where this is noted], which poses challenges for [explain what aspect of the research is affected]. In fact, [introduce evidence or findings that support this observation], thus [explain the implications of these findings].

\subsection{Contribution}
In this work, we focus on addressing [state the specific shortcomings or gaps identified in previous research] and propose [briefly introduce the new framework, architecture, or methodology]. Note that our approach is not aimed at [state what the research does not intend to achieve], but rather we seek to [state the primary goals of the research]. Specifically, we propose [introduce the new datasets, experiments, or models being introduced], which [explain the significance or anticipated outcomes]. Fittingly, our experiments demonstrate that [describe the expected superiority or advantages of the proposed approach over existing methods].
