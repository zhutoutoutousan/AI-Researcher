\section{Abstract}

Users' interactions with items are driven by various intents (e.g., [example intents]). However, users' underlying intents are often [characterization of intents, e.g., unobserved/latent], making it challenging to leverage such latent intents for [specific application, e.g., Sequential recommendation (SR)]. To investigate the benefits of latent intents and leverage them effectively for [application], we propose [method name], a [general description of the method, e.g., general learning paradigm] that integrates a [latent intent variable/parameter] into [application]. The core idea is to [main idea of the method, e.g., learn users' intent distribution functions] from [type of data, e.g., unlabeled user behavior sequences] and optimize [specific model/approach] with [technique, e.g., contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL)] by considering the [learnt intents/parameters] to improve [outcome, e.g., recommendation].

Specifically, we introduce a [description of the variable] to represent users' intents and learn the [distribution function/representation] of the [variable] via [method]. We propose to leverage the [learnt intents/variables] into [application] via [technical method], which [focus on key operation, e.g., maximizes the agreement]. The training process consists of [brief outline of steps, e.g., alternating between intent representation learning and model optimization] within [framework, e.g., the generalized expectation-maximization (EM) framework]. Fusing [additional context, e.g., user intent information] into [application] also [benefit, e.g., improves model robustness].

Experiments conducted on [description of datasets, e.g., several real-world datasets] demonstrate the superiority of the proposed [method/approach], which [key results, e.g., improves performance and robustness against challenges, e.g., data sparsity and noisy interaction issues].
