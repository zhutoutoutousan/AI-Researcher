\section{Abstract}

Representation learning on [target domain] has evolved from using [previous methods or techniques] to [recent advancements or approaches]. This progression leads to the success of [specific models or methodologies] for [application area] such as [Model 1] and [Model 2]. Despite their effectiveness, we argue that they suffer from two limitations: (1) [first limitation] and (2) [second limitation].

In this work, we explore [new approach or technique] to improve the [desired outcome] of [target models or methods]. The idea is to supplement the classical [main task] with an auxiliary [secondary task], which reinforces [specific process] via [specific mechanism]. Specifically, we [describe the core concept or innovative idea]. We devise [number] strategies to achieve this - [strategy 1], [strategy 2], and [strategy 3] - that [explain how each strategy functions or alters the existing structures]. We term this new approach as [new paradigm or concept], implementing it on [specific state-of-the-art model]. Through [type of analyses], we find that [key findings or theoretical insights]. Empirical studies on [number] benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of [new approach], which [summarize outcomes, e.g., improvements in accuracy or robustness]. Our implementations are available at [link to repository or supplementary materials].
