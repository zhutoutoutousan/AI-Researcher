[Briefly describe the workflow of the proposed module.]

Formally, we define [concept] as follows: 

\begin{equation}
[Insert mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Provide a detailed explanation of each term in the equations.]

[Discuss the comparison of the proposed method with existing approaches.]

Furthermore, [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. Our extensive experiments on [mention the datasets] demonstrate [summarize the performance results]. 

[Conclude with additional insights and implications.]

To this end, [briefly mention findings about the method's effectiveness in a specific context or additional properties demonstrated by experiments, like efficient modeling of long sequences].
