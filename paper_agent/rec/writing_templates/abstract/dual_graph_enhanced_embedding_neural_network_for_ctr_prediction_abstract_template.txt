\section*{Abstract}

\noindent [Begin with a concise statement about the main theme or objective of the research, such as the problem being addressed or the importance of the study.] For instance, "CTR prediction, which aims to estimate the probability that a user will click an item, plays a crucial role in [relevant application area]."

\noindent [Describe the existing methods related to the problem, including their main advantages and limitations.] This can be formatted as: "Feature interaction modeling based and user interest mining based methods are the two kinds of most popular techniques that have been extensively explored for many years and have made great progress for [specific application]. However, [briefly outline the main challenges faced by these methods]."

\noindent [List the challenges in detail using structured bullet points or numbered list.] For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (1) [Challenge 1 description, e.g., "feature interaction based methods..."]
    \item (2) [Challenge 2 description, e.g., "user interest mining based methods..."]
\end{itemize}

\noindent [Introduce your proposed solution or methodology, mentioning its name and its objective.] For example, "To solve these problems, we propose a novel module named [module name], which is compatible with [relevant techniques or models] to address [specific problems]."

\noindent [Outline the main aspects or components of your method.] For instance, "We further propose a [specific method or framework name] for [specific application]. [Method name] exploits [key concept] with two carefully designed learning strategies: [strategy 1] and [strategy 2] to [objective of the strategies]."

\noindent [Include a brief statement about the evaluation method.] This could look like: "We conduct comprehensive experiments on [mention the datasets or contexts] using [evaluation metrics]."

\noindent [Summarize the results succinctly, emphasizing the key findings.] Example: "The experimental results show that our proposed [method name] significantly outperforms [mention existing baselines or state-of-the-art models]."

\noindent [Add any additional insights or implications of the results.] For instance: "Moreover, when applied to [specific context or models], [your method] consistently achieves better performance." 

\noindent [Mention any future work or contributions to the community, if applicable.] You can say, "Our framework will be open-source based on [specific platform] in the near future."
