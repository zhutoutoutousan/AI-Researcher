\section{Abstract}

Low-dimensional embeddings of nodes in large graphs have proved extremely useful in a variety of prediction tasks, including [Task 1] and [Task 2]. However, most existing approaches [Describe Limitation and Challenge]. In this work, we present [Module Name], a [Description of the Proposed Framework] that [Functionality or Objective]. Instead of [Describe Previous Technique], our method [Brief Overview of the New Approach]. Our algorithm [Describe Performance Results and Comparison], demonstrating its effectiveness on [Benchmarks or Datasets].
