\section{Abstract}

[Introduction to the subject area and its significance. Clearly state the field of study and the problem being addressed.]

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module.]

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}
[Detailed explanation of each term in the equations.]

Furthermore, we compare the proposed method with existing approaches. [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches, highlighting advantages and possible limitations.]

Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through [type of evaluation or analysis] on [datasets or benchmarks]. The results indicate that [summary of findings and implications]. We publish the source code at [link to repository].
