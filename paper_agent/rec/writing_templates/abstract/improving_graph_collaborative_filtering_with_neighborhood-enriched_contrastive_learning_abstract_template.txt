\section*{Abstract}

Recently, [general area of research or application] methods have been proposed as an effective [approach/technique], which can capture [describe the underlying mechanism or interaction] by modeling [specify what is being modeled]. Despite their effectiveness, these methods suffer from [identify a common issue or challenge in the field]. In order to [describe the goal or improvement sought], [specific technique or method] is adopted in [application or field] for enhancing performance. However, these methods typically [describe a common limitation of current approaches].

To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel [type of method or approach], named [module name], which explicitly incorporates [explain the novel aspect or feature]. Specifically, we [briefly outline the key features or components of the proposed approach]. 

For the [describe a key component or source of data], we develop [describe the objective or method related to this component]. In implementation, [explain how different elements are represented or utilized]. Furthermore, to [describe an additional aspect or consideration], we [explain the additional mechanism or relation being incorporated] and incorporate these aspects into [describe what objective or method is being improved]. 

The proposed [module name] can be optimized with [describe the optimization technique or algorithm] and generalized to apply to [mention the broader category it can be applied to]. Extensive experiments on [describe datasets or benchmarks used] demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed [module name], notably with [describe specific performance gains or improvements], in comparison to [mention a competitive baseline or existing method]. Our implementation code is available at: [insert URL].
