\section*{Abstract}

Incorporating [concept/technique] into [application domain] is promising in improving [specific outcomes, e.g., accuracy, efficiency]. However, existing methods largely assume that [key assumption about the concept/technique] and [describe the limitation or challenge]. This may lead to [consequences of the limitation], since [explain why the limitation is critical]. Thus, we argue that it is crucial to consider [alternative consideration or perspective] when [applying the concept/technique in the application domain].

In this paper, we [brief statement of the main contribution]. Distinct from [previous work or common approaches], we [explain how the proposed method differs and its purpose]. For instance, [give an example that illustrates the method or insight and its implications for understanding the problem better].

Technically, we contribute a [briefly describe the proposed model or methodology], which [explain key features and innovations of the model/method]. We then [describe how the model/method will be trained or evaluated, mentioning key components or processes involved]. Extensive experiments on [mention type of datasets or scenarios] show that our method [state the performance or advantage over existing methods]. Further analysis verifies [summarize findings related to the effectiveness or benefits of the method]. We publish our project at [link to the resources, if applicable].
