\section{Experiments}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [component 1]
    \item [component 2]
    \item [component 3]
\end{itemize}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
