\section{Experiments}

In Sec. \ref{sec:performance} and Sec. \ref{sec:ablation}, we perform [type of experiments] on [dataset]. We carry out [method] and then [subsequent process]. We report [evaluation metric] on the [evaluation set]. In Sec. \ref{sec:influence}, we study [additional aspect or datasets].

\subsection{Performance}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. 

To tackle [specific challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

Figure \ref{fig:comparison} compares [method 1] vs. [method 2]. The [method 1 description] follows [reference] and has [accuracy/metric]. As a comparison, [method 2 description] achieves [performance], which has a [quantitative increase] compared to [previous method]. This gap is significant compared to [related task/metric].

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
[header 1] & [header 2] & [header 3] \\
\hline
[data 1] & [data 2] & [data 3] \\
[data 4] & [data 5] & [data 6] \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Ablation Experiments}

We study [aspect of experiments]. Figure \ref{fig:ablation} shows the influence of [factor] on [performance metric]. [Description of results]. 

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{[Ablation table title]}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
[header 1] & [header 2] & [header 3] \\
\hline
[data 1] & [data 2] & [data 3] \\
[data 4] & [data 5] & [data 6] \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Specifically, we analyze [specific parameter or method]. Our method follows [related method/structure]. Table \ref{tab:statistical} reports [specific results and metrics]. 

\subsection{Influence of Data}

We perform transfer learning ablation on [datasets] with downstream tasks [task names]. We do not perform [specific process], allowing us to focus on [data characteristics].

First, we compare [different methods or datasets]. We observe [results/insights]. 

\subsection{System-level Comparisons}

We provide system-level comparisons with [leading results]. The detailed tables are in the appendix. [Analysis of results and relevant features].

\subsection{[Additional Focus Area]}

Finally, we report [type of results or preliminary findings] on [specific application]. The usage of [method or structure] allows us to [describe advantages]. [Discussion of results and their implications].
