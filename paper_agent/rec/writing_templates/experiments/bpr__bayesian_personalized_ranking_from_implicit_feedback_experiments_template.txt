\section{Evaluation}

In our evaluation, we compare [method/approach] to other [methods/approaches]. We have chosen the two popular model classes of [class 1] and [class 2]. [Class 1] models are known to outperform [previous work/technique] for the related task of [related task]. In our evaluation, the [class 1] models are learned by [methods/techniques used], i.e. [method 1], [method 2], and [our proposed method]. For [class 2], we compare [method 1] to a model that has been optimized using [our method]. Additionally, we report results for the baseline [baseline method], that [description of the baseline]. Furthermore, we give the theoretical upper bound on [metric] for any [type] ranking method.

\subsection{Datasets}

We use [number] datasets of [description of applications]. The [dataset 1 name] dataset is from [source]. It contains [description of data], totaling [number] [data points]. The task is to [task description]. The second dataset is the [dataset 2 name] dataset from [source]. This dataset contains [description of data]. As we want to solve an implicit feedback task, we removed [specific details about what was removed]. Now the task is to [task description]. For [dataset 2 name], we created a subsample of [number] users, [number] items containing [number] [data points]. We draw the subsample such that [conditions for subsample].

\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}

We use the [evaluation scheme description], where we [description of the evaluation process]. This results in a disjoint train set \( S_{\text{train}} \) and test set \( S_{\text{test}} \). The models are then learned on \( S_{\text{train}} \) and their predicted rankings are evaluated on the test set \( S_{\text{test}} \) by the average [metric/statistic]:

\begin{equation}
\text{metric} = [mathematical formulation]
\end{equation}

where the evaluation pairs per user \( u \) are:

\begin{equation}
E(u) := [definition of evaluation pairs]
\end{equation}

A higher value of [metric] indicates [interpretation of metric]. The trivial [metric] of a random method is [value] and the best achievable quality is [value].

We repeated all experiments [number] times by drawing new train/test splits in each round. The hyperparameters for all methods are optimized via [optimization method] in the first round and are kept constant in the remaining [number] repetitions.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

Figure [number] shows the [metric quality] of all models on the [number] datasets. First of all, you can see that [comparison of results]. Comparing the same models among each other one can see [observations about model comparisons]. For example, [detailed explanation of comparison]. [Further observations about optimization or performance]. 

To summarize, our results show [main findings]. The empirical results indicate that [conclusion based on findings]. The results are justified by [supporting argument or analysis].

\subsection{Non-personalized ranking}

Finally, we compare the [metric quality] of our [type] methods to the best possible non-personalized ranking method. In contrast to our [type] methods, a non-personalized ranking method [description of the method]. We compute the theoretical upper-bound [metric description] by optimizing the ranking on the test set \( S_{\text{test}} \). Figure [number] shows that even simple [personalized methods] largely outperform the upper-bound and thus also all non-personalized methods.
