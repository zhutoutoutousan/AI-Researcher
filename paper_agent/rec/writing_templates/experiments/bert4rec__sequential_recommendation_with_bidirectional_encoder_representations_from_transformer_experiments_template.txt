\subsection{Datasets}
We evaluate the proposed model on [number] real-world representative datasets which vary significantly in [domains/sparsity/detail].

\begin{itemize}
    \item [Dataset 1]: [Description of dataset 1 and its origin].
    \item [Dataset 2]: [Description of dataset 2 and its origin].
    \item [Dataset 3]: [Description of dataset 3 and its origin].
\end{itemize}

For dataset preprocessing, we follow the common practices outlined in [references]. Specifically, we [describe preprocessing steps, e.g., converting feedback to implicit interactions, grouping interaction records]. To ensure the quality of the dataset, we [describe any filtering criteria, such as user participation]. The statistics of the processed datasets are summarized in Table [number].

\subsection{Baselines \& Implementation Details}
To verify the effectiveness of our method, we compare it with the following representative baselines: 

\begin{itemize}

    \item [Baseline 3]: [Description of baseline 3].
\end{itemize}

We implement [our model] using [framework/libraries]. All parameters are initialized using [initialization strategy]. We train the model using [optimizer] with specific learning rate settings and other key hyperparameters [briefly describe configuration and tuning process].

\subsection{Ablation Study}
Finally, we perform ablation experiments on several key components of [model name] to understand their impacts, including [list components]. 

Table [number] presents the results of [base model] and its variants on [datasets]. We [introduce each variant and analyze its effect]:
