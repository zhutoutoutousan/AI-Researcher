\section{EVALUATION}

To verify the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed [method name], we perform extensive experiments to answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1: [State the first research question]
    \item RQ2: [State the second research question]
    \item RQ3: [State the third research question]
    \item RQ4: [State the fourth research question]
    \item RQ5: [State the fifth research question]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS}

\subsubsection{DATASETS AND EVALUATION PROTOCOLS}

We evaluate our model and the baselines on [number] real-world datasets: [Dataset 1 description], [Dataset 2 description], [Dataset 3 description], [Dataset 4 description], and [Dataset 5 description].

We adopt [evaluation metric 1] and [evaluation metric 2] as the evaluation metrics, where [details about metrics].

\subsubsection{BASELINE METHODS}

We compare our model against [number] state-of-the-art baselines with different learning paradigms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [Baseline method 1]
    \item [Baseline method 2]
    \item [Baseline method 3]
    \item [Baseline method 4]
    \item [Baseline method 5]
    \item [Additional baselines as necessary]
\end{itemize}

Due to space limits, the detailed descriptions of baselines are presented in Appendix [letter].

\subsubsection{HYPERPARAMETER SETTINGS}

To ensure a fair comparison, we tune the hyperparameters of all the baselines within the ranges suggested in the original papers, except the following fixed settings for all the models: [describe fixed settings].

For our [method name], the hyperparameters [hyperparameter 1], [hyperparameter 2], and [hyperparameter 3] are tuned from [range of values for hyperparameter 1], [range for hyperparameter 2], and [range for hyperparameter 3], respectively.
