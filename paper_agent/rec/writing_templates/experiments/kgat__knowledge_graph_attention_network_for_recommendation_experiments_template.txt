\section{Experiments}
We evaluate our proposed method, particularly the [module name], on [number] real-world datasets. We aim to answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1: How does [proposed method] perform compared with state-of-the-art [related methods]?
    \item RQ2: How do different components (i.e., [component 1], [component 2], [component 3]) affect [proposed method]?
    \item RQ3: Can [proposed method] provide reasonable explanations about [research aspect]?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dataset Description}
To evaluate the effectiveness of [proposed method], we utilize [number] benchmark datasets: [dataset 1], [dataset 2], and [dataset 3], which are publicly accessible and vary in terms of [characteristics such as domain, size, and sparsity].

\textbf{[Dataset 1]:} [Description of the dataset including source, settings, and quality assurance methods.]

\textbf{[Dataset 2]:} [Description of the dataset including source, settings, and quality assurance methods.]

\textbf{[Dataset 3]:} [Description of the dataset including source, settings, and quality assurance methods.]

In addition to [dataset characteristics], we construct [knowledge representation] for each dataset. We summarize the statistics in [Table/Figure Reference].

For each dataset, we randomly select [percentage]% of [data type] to constitute the training set and treat the remaining as the test set. [Detailed procedure for validation and negative sampling strategy.]

\subsection{Experimental Settings}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
For each [unit of analysis, e.g., user] in the test set, we [description of evaluation process]. We adopt [number] widely-used evaluation metrics: [metric 1] and [metric 2]. By default, we set [parameter value]. [Explanation of metric reporting.]

\subsubsection{Baselines}
To demonstrate the effectiveness, we compare our proposed [method] with [number] baseline methods, including [baseline 1], [baseline 2], ..., [baseline n], as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [Baseline 1]: [Brief description of what it does and its relevance].
    \item [Baseline 2]: [Brief description of what it does and its relevance].
    \item [Baseline n]: [Brief description of what it does and its relevance].
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parameter Settings}
We implement our [method] in [framework/language]. The [parameter] is fixed to [value] for all models, except [any exceptions]. We optimize all models with [optimization method], where [additional parameter settings and search strategies]. 

\subsection{Performance Comparison (RQ1)}
We first report the performance of all the methods and then investigate [specific focus of the analysis].

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Method & [Metric 1] & [Metric 2] & [Metric 3] & [Metric 4] \\ \hline
        [Baseline 1] & [value] & [value] & [value] & [value] \\ \hline
        [Baseline n] & [value] & [value] & [value] & [value] \\ \hline
        [Proposed Method] & [value] & [value] & [value] & [value] \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Overall Comparison}
The performance comparison results are presented in [Table Reference]. We have the following observations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [Observation 1]
    \item [Observation 2]
    \item [Observation 3]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Comparison w.r.t. Interaction Sparsity Levels}
[Discussion on interaction sparsity levels and their significance on the analysis.]

\subsection{Study of [Proposed Method] (RQ2)}
To gain deeper insights on [specific component or behavior], we investigate its impact. [Follow with specific analyses related to component variations, settings, or impacts, using structured subsections.]

\subsubsection{Effect of Model Depth}
We vary the depth of [proposed method] to investigate [specific focus]. [Insert observations, results in tabular format or figures, and insights.]

\subsubsection{Effect of [Additional Factors]}
[Continue with variations relevant to the method's components or configurations, structuring results as necessary.]

\subsubsection{Effect of Knowledge Representation and Attention Mechanism}
We perform ablation studies by considering [variants of proposed method]. [Summarize findings and observations.]

\subsection{Case Study (RQ3)}
Leveraging the attention mechanism, we select [specific instance] and extract [behavior-based or attribute-based connectivity]. We visualize [Figure Reference] to illustrate [findings]. The key observations are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [Observation 1]
    \item [Observation 2]
\end{itemize}
