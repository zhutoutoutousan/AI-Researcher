\section{Experiments}
We provide empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed [Module Name]. The experiments are designed to answer the following research questions:

- RQ1: [Research Question 1]
- RQ2: [Research Question 2]
- RQ3: [Research Question 3]

\subsection{Experimental Settings}

\subsubsection{Dataset Description}
We use [number] benchmark datasets for [application area] in the experiments: (1) [Dataset details]; and (2) [Additional dataset details]. We extract such attributes as [attributes] as the knowledge graph data.

Moreover, in order to ensure data quality, we adopt the [data quality setting] setting, i.e., [data quality details]. The statistics of datasets are summarized in Table [X], where we [summarize data specifics]. Following prior studies, we use the same data partition. In the training phase, [describe the training phase details].

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
In the evaluation phase, we conduct the [evaluation strategy] [citation]. More specifically, for each user, [define evaluation criteria]. To evaluate top-$K$ recommendations, we adopt the [protocols] where $K$ is set as [default value]. We report the average metrics for all users in the testing set.

\subsubsection{Alternative Baselines}
We compare [Module Name] with the state-of-the-art methods, covering [method categories]:

- 1. [Baseline method 1]
- 2. [Baseline method 2]
- 3. [Baseline method 3]
- 4. [Baseline method 4]

\subsubsection{Parameter Settings}
We implement our [Module Name] model in [framework], and have released our implementations ([code, datasets, parameter settings, and training logs]) to facilitate reproducibility. For a fair comparison, we fix [parameter settings]. A grid search is conducted to confirm the optimal settings for each method; specifically, [parameter tuning details]. 

The detailed settings of [Module Name] are provided in Appendix [A.X]. We observe that using [equations] have similar trends and performance; hence, we report the results of [specific model]. Without specification, we fix [default parameters].

\subsection{Performance Comparison (RQ1)}
We begin with the comparison w.r.t. [metric]. The empirical results are reported in Table [X], where [describe what the table presents]. We find that:

- [Observation 1]
- [Observation 2]
- [Observation 3]

\subsection{[Further Analysis/Comparative Insights] (RQ2)}
As the modeling is at the core of [Module Name], we also conduct [type of studies] to investigate the effectiveness. Specifically, we assess [specific factors impacting results].

\subsubsection{[Section/Factor 1]}
We first answer the question: [specific question]. To this end, we summarize the results in Table [X]. [Discuss findings, implications, and observational insights].

\subsubsection{[Section/Factor 2]}
We then consider [what is varied]. Here we search [parameter range] and summarize the results in Table [X]. We observe that:

- [Insight 1]
- [Insight 2]

\subsection{Explainability of [Module Name] (RQ3)}
In this section, we present the semantics of [specific concepts] and offer [number] examples to give an intuitive impression of our explainability. As shown in Figure [X], we have the following observations:

- [Observation 1]
- [Observation 2]
- [Observation 3]
