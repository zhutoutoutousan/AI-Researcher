\section{Experiments}

In this section, we conduct experiments on different real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our method from the following aspects:

- \textbf{RQ1:} Does [Module Name] consistently outperform other baselines in terms of [Performance Metric]?

\caption{Statistics of Experimented Datasets.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{[Dataset 1]} & \textbf{[Dataset 2]} & \textbf{[Dataset 3]} \\ \hline

- \textbf{RQ2:} How does the performance of [Module Name]'s variants compare with different configurations?
- \textbf{RQ3:} How is the forecasting performance of compared methods with respect to different interaction density degrees?
- \textbf{RQ4:} How do the representations benefit from the collectively encoding of [Concept] in [Context]?
- \textbf{RQ5:} How do different hyper-parameter settings impact the performance of our [Module Name] framework?
- \textbf{RQ6:} How is the model efficiency of the [Module Name]?

\paragraph{Evaluation Protocols.} We adopt [Evaluation Metrics] for [Task]. We follow the evaluation settings in [Previous Work] and employ [Methodology] for generating training and test instances. 

\paragraph{Baselines.} In our experiments, we perform the performance comparison by considering the following baselines:
- [Baseline Method 1]: [Brief description of the baseline method].
- [Baseline Method 2]: [Brief description of the baseline method].
- [Additional Baselines as necessary].
