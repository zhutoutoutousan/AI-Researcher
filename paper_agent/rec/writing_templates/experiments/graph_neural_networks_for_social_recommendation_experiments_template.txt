In our experiments, we choose [number] representative datasets [Dataset 1, Dataset 2], which are taken from [source/explanation of datasets]. Each [description of the source] allows [purpose or use of the datasets]. The [measurement scale or metrics], [specific initialization method], and the statistics of these datasets are presented in Table [number].

\textbf{Dataset} & [Dataset 1] & [Dataset 2] \\ \hline
# of Users & [value] & [value] \\ \hline

# of Ratings & [value] & [value] \\ \hline
# of Density (Ratings) & [value] & [value] \\ \hline
# of Social Connections & [value] & [value] \\ \hline
# of Density (Social Relations) & [value] & [value] \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics}
In order to evaluate the quality of [type of algorithms], two popular metrics are adopted to evaluate the predictive accuracy, namely [Metric 1] and [Metric 2]. Smaller values of [Metric 1] and [Metric 2] indicate [indication of better performance]. Note that [any additional notes regarding improvement effects].

\subsubsection{Baselines}
To evaluate the performance, we compared our [Proposed Method] with [number] groups of methods including [Group 1], [Group 2], and [Group 3]. For each group, we select representative baselines detailed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [Baseline Method 1]: [Description of Baseline Method 1]
    \item [Baseline Method 2]: [Description of Baseline Method 2]
    \item [Baseline Method 3]: [Description of Baseline Method 3]
    \item [Additional Baselines as necessary]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parameter Settings}
We implemented our proposed method using [framework/libraries used]. For each dataset, we used [percentage] as a training set, \([1 - x\%]/2\) as a validation set, and \([1 - x\%]/2\) as a testing set for final performance comparison, where \(x\) was varied as \{[values]\}. For [parameter], we tested the value of [range of values]. The [other parameters] were explored in the range of [lists or ranges of values]. Additionally, [any special strategies or initialization methods used].
