\section{Experiments}

We test our model in a number of experiments: [Briefly state the different experiments conducted]. 

\subsection{Datasets}

We closely follow the experimental setup in [Reference previous work]. Dataset statistics are summarized in Table [X]. In [Type of datasets], [Explanation of nodes and edges]. Label rate denotes the [Define what the label rate indicates]. [Description of each dataset, its nature, and relevant statistics].

\subsection{Experimental Set-Up}

Unless otherwise noted, we train [Model details] as described in [Section/Reference]. We evaluate prediction accuracy on [Describe the evaluation process]. Additional experiments using [Describe any additional configurations] are provided in [Reference/Appendix]. 

For [Describe datasets], we optimize hyperparameters on [Specific dataset] only and use the same set of parameters for [Other datasets]. We train all models for a maximum of [Number] [Type of iterations] using [Optimizer] with a learning rate of [Value] and early stopping with a window size of [Value]. We initialize weights using [Initialization method] and normalize input features according to [Normalization technique].

\subsection{Baselines}

We compare against the same baseline methods as in [Reference], including [List baseline methods]. We omit [Any omitted methods with justification].

Furthermore, we compare against [Any additional methods or techniques you wish to compare]. We first [Describe the comparative methodology], then run [Describe the iterative process] for [Number] iterations on [Describe nodes or sets].

Lastly, we compare against [Name any other models or methods], where we choose [Specify criteria for comparison] as a baseline.
