\section{EXPERIMENTS}

In this section, we conduct experiments aimed at addressing the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1: [State the first research question]
    \item RQ2: [State the second research question]
    \item RQ3: [State the third research question]
\end{itemize}

In what follows, we first present the experimental settings, followed by addressing the above research questions.

\subsection{Experimental Settings}

\textbf{Datasets.} We experimented with [insert number] publicly accessible datasets: [Dataset 1 Name] and [Dataset 2 Name]. The characteristics of the datasets are summarized in Table \ref{table:datasets}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Dataset & Interaction\# & Item\# & User\# & Sparsity \\
        \hline
        [Dataset 1 Name] & [Data1 Interaction#] & [Data1 Item#] & [Data1 User#] & [Data1 Sparsity] \\
        [Dataset 2 Name] & [Data2 Interaction#] & [Data2 Item#] & [Data2 User#] & [Data2 Sparsity] \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Statistics of the evaluation datasets.}
    \label{table:datasets}
\end{table}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

\textbf{Evaluation Protocols.} We adopted [describe the evaluation protocol], using [describe metrics, e.g., Hit Ratio, NDCG] to measure the performance.

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches.]

\textbf{Baselines.} We compared our proposed methods, [Method 1], [Method 2], and [Method 3], with the following baselines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [Baseline 1 Description]
    \item [Baseline 2 Description]
    \item [Baseline 3 Description]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Parameter Settings.} We implemented our proposed models based on [Framework/Library]. To determine hyper-parameters, we [describe the hyper-parameter tuning approach]. [Further details about model training and parameter settings.]

\subsection{Performance Comparison (RQ1)}

[Insert performance comparison results related to RQ1, including figures and interpretations.]

\subsubsection{[Subsection Title Related to RQ1, if needed]}

[Discuss any specific experiments or observations related to RQ1 with supporting data.]

\subsection{[Next Research Question Title] (RQ2)}

[Insert performance results and discussions regarding RQ2.]

\subsection{Is [Method/Approach] Helpful? (RQ3)}

[Insert analysis related to RQ3, discussing the utility of certain techniques, structures, or methodologies with pertinent results.]

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Factors & [Metric 1] & [Metric 2] & [Metric 3] \\
        \hline
        [Condition 1] & [Result1] & [Result1 Metric 2] & [Result1 Metric 3] \\
        [Condition 2] & [Result2] & [Result2 Metric 2] & [Result2 Metric 3] \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Performance of [method] with [different configurations].}
    \label{table:performance}
\end{table}

[Further analysis on how model architecture or configuration affects the results.]
