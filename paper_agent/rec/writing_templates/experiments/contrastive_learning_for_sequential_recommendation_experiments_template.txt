\section{Experiments}
In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1: How does the proposed [Module Name] perform compared to the state-of-the-art baselines in the [Task]?
    \item RQ2: How do different [Augmentation Methods] impact the performance? What is the influence of different [Hyper-parameters] on [Module Name] performance?
    \item RQ3: How does the weight $\lambda$ of [Loss Function] impact performance under the [Framework]?
    \item RQ4: How do different components of [Module Name] benefit its performance, i.e., [Component 1] and [Component 2]?
    \item RQ5: Does our [Module Name] really learn a better representation in [Domain] compared with other state-of-the-art baselines?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experiment Settings}
\subsubsection{Datasets}
We conduct experiments on [Number] public datasets collected from [Description of Platforms]. [Details on Dataset Collection and Preprocessing]. The processed data statistics are summarized in Table \ref{table:dataset_statistics}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Dataset statistics (after preprocessing).}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Dataset & \# Users & \# Items & \# Actions & Avg. Length & Density \\
        \hline
        [Dataset 1] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] \\
        [Dataset 2] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] \\
        [Dataset 3] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] \\
        [Dataset 4] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{table:dataset_statistics}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Evaluation}
We adopt the [Evaluation Strategy] to assess the performance of each method. Specifically, we hold out [Description of Train/Validation/Test Split]. To ensure consistency, we evaluate each method using [Performance Metrics] and report results for [Values of k].

\subsubsection{Baselines}
To verify the effectiveness of our method, we compare it with the following representative baselines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Baseline 1 Description]
    \item [Baseline 2 Description]
    \item [Baseline 3 Description]
    \item [Further Baselines as Needed]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}
We implement the methods using [Framework]. For [Module Name], we set [Parameter Settings] and train the model with [Optimization Details]. We also investigate the impact of [Parameter Adjustments] in our experiments.

\subsection{Overall Performance Comparison (RQ1)}
To answer RQ1, we compare the performance of our [Module Name] with the above baselines. Table \ref{table:overall_performance} summarizes the results across datasets. Based on the experimental results, we can observe that [Key Observations].

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Overall performance comparison.}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Method & Dataset 1 & Dataset 2 & Dataset 3 & Dataset 4 \\
        \hline
        [Method 1] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] \\
        [Method 2] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] \\
        [Method 3] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] & [Value] \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{table:overall_performance}
\end{table}

\subsection{Comparison of Different Augmentation Methods (RQ2)}
To answer RQ2, we analyze the impact of different [Augmentation Methods] on performance. [Description of Experimental Setup]. We observe a few trends, including [Key Observations Related to Augmentations].

\subsection{Impact of [Specific Component] (RQ3)}
To answer RQ3, we investigate how [Specific Component] interacts with [Another Component]. [Brief Description of Findings and Observations].

\subsection{Ablation Study (RQ4)}
We perform an ablation study on [Module Name] to show how [Components] affect its performance. [Key Findings Related to the Ablation Study].

\subsection{Quality of User Representations (RQ5)}
As mentioned above, [Module Name] can infer better representations in [Specific Context] compared with other baselines. We measure this by [Methodology for Evaluation]. [Results and Conclusions Based on Analysis].
