\section{Experiments}

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed [Method Name], we conduct extensive experiments and report detailed analysis results.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection{Datasets.} To evaluate the performance of the proposed [Method Name], we use [number] public datasets to conduct experiments: [Dataset 1], [Dataset 2], [Dataset 3], [Dataset 4], and [Dataset 5]. These datasets vary in domains, scale, and density. For [Dataset 2] and [Dataset 3], we filter out users and items with fewer than [number] interactions to ensure data quality. The statistics of the datasets are summarized in Table [Number]. For each dataset, we randomly select [percentage]% of interactions as training data and [percentage]% of interactions as validation data. The remaining [percentage]% interactions are used for performance comparison. We uniformly sample [number] negative items for each positive instance to form the training set.

\subsubsection{Compared Models.} We compare the proposed method with the following baseline methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Baseline Model 1] [brief description of the model and its approach]
    \item [Baseline Model 2] [brief description of the model and its approach]
    \item [Baseline Model 3] [brief description of the model and its approach]
    \item [Baseline Model 4] [brief description of the model and its approach]
    \item [Baseline Model 5] [brief description of the model and its approach]
    \item [Baseline Model 6] [brief description of the model and its approach]
\end{itemize}
  
\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics.} To evaluate the performance of top-$N$ recommendation, we adopt two widely used metrics [Metric 1] and [Metric 2], where $N$ is set to [value 1], [value 2], and [value 3] for consistency. Following [reference], we adopt the [ranking strategy type] strategy, which ranks all the candidate items that the user has not interacted with.

\subsubsection{Implementation Details.} We implement the proposed model and all the baselines with [Framework Name], which is a [description of the framework]. To ensure a fair comparison, we optimize all the methods with [optimizer type] and carefully search the hyper-parameters of all the baselines. The batch size is set to [number] and all parameters are initialized using [initialization method]. We adopt early stopping with the patience of [number] epochs to prevent overfitting, and [metric] is set as the indicator. We tune the hyper-parameters [Hyperparameter 1] and [Hyperparameter 2] in [range 1] and [Hyperparameter 3] in [range 2].

\subsection{Overall Performance}

Table [Number] shows the performance comparison of the proposed [Method Name] and other baseline methods on [number] datasets. From the table, we find several observations:

(1) [Observation about the performance of the proposed method compared to traditional methods.]

(2) [Observation regarding the performance of other methods, referencing specific models and datasets.]

(3) Finally, we see that the proposed [Method Name] consistently performs better than baselines. This advantage is attributed to [brief explanation for the performance advantage, including any relevant discussion on data sparsity or alternative methods used].

\subsection{Further Analysis of [Method Name]}

In this section, we further perform a series of detailed analyses on the proposed [Method Name] to confirm its effectiveness. We conduct the following analyses:

\subsubsection{Ablation Study.} To verify the effectiveness of [specific components], we conduct the ablation study to analyze their contributions. The results are reported in Figure [Number].

\subsubsection{Impact of Data Sparsity Levels.} To further verify that the proposed [Method Name] alleviates the sparsity of interaction data, we evaluate its performance on users with different sparsity levels and report the results in Figure [Number].

\subsubsection{Effect of [Component Name].} We investigate the impact of [specific component] in [Method Name]. The results are shown in Table [Number].

\subsubsection{Impact of [Hyperparameter Name].} We analyze the influence of [specific hyperparameter] by varying it in the range of [range] and report the results in Figure [Number].

\subsubsection{Impact of [Another Hyperparameter Name].} We analyze the impact of [another specific hyperparameter] on [Method Name] by varying [hyperparameter name] in the range of [range] and report the results in Figure [Number].

\subsubsection{Applying [Method Name] on Other Architectures.} To test the performance of [Method Name] with other architectures, we present the results in Table [Number].

\subsubsection{Visualizing the Distribution of Representations.} We visualize the learned embeddings in Figure [Number] to understand how the proposed approach affects representation learning and show the distributions.
