\section{Discussion}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

Formally, we define [concept] as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

Specifically, [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].

Furthermore, [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module].

In comparison, [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. 

To this end, we acknowledge the limitations of our approach. It is [explain limitations, challenges, and possible oversights in experimentation]. 

Indeed, we [describe the decision to limit certain explorations or optimizations].

Moreover, it would be interesting to [suggest future directions or improvements based on identified challenges, referencing relevant literature if applicable].

In summary, [briefly recapitulate the main findings and implications of the proposed method, emphasizing the significance of these contributions].
