\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work, we explored [general area of study or technique used in the research]. We devised a general framework [framework name] and proposed [number] instantiations - [name of instantiation 1], [name of instantiation 2], and [name of instantiation 3] - that [description of the approach and its variations]. Our framework is [describe the adaptability and purpose of the framework]; it is not limited to the models presented in this paper, but is designed to serve as a guideline for [future development or application]. This work complements [name of existing work or model], opening up a new avenue of research possibilities for [broad field of study or application].

In future, we will study [future research direction or applications]. Furthermore, we aim to extend [current model/approach] to [describe additional features or aspects to be included], such as [specific elements or data types]. While [brief commentary on the current state of research], it is interesting to develop [new models/approaches] for [new aspect or target group], which [explain the significance of this new focus]. Moreover, we are particularly interested in [emerging topic or technique] for [broader goal], an interesting task that has received [comment on the level of scrutiny] in the [specific research community]. [Description of the benefits or challenges related to the emerging topic]. To achieve this, we need to [outline approaches or methods needed for the new task]. Another emerging direction is to explore [new techniques or methodologies] for [particular aim], particularly for [specific challenges or opportunities]. 

[Conclude with a brief statement highlighting the importance and implications of future work].
