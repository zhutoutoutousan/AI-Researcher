\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we explore [research area/technique] and identify the common issues that are faced by [related processes/methods]. We present [proposed method/module name] to address [challenge] from the perspective of [focus areas, e.g., objectives, learning strategies, criteria, model frameworks]. In [proposed method/module name], we design [key strategy or feature] with [specific criterion or method] as the [specific role, e.g., evaluation criterion]. 

We conduct extensive experiments on [types of datasets or benchmarks], and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of [proposed method/module name]. Our work shows that [insight or finding related to research area] can offer great potential to [broader context or application], requiring more in-depth explorations for future work.
