\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we revisited [briefly describe the foundational topic or current state of the field], and proposed [module name] to address [specific challenge]. 

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

The [module name] was mainly composed of [number] parts: First, [describe the first part and its significance]. Second, [describe the second part and its significance]. 

Specifically, [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module].

Extensive experimental results [briefly outline results or findings] clearly showed the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model. 

Furthermore, we compared our method with existing approaches, highlighting [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches].

To this end, we formally define [concept or mathematical formulation] as follows:

\begin{equation}
    [Insert key mathematical formulation here]
\end{equation}

where [Detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

In the future, we aim to [describe future research directions or expansions on the current work].
