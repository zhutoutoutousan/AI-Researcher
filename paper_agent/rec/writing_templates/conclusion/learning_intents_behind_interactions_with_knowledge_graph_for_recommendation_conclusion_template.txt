\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work, we focused on [general topic or area of study]. We proposed a novel framework, [module name], which approaches better [key objective] from two dimensions: (1) [dimension 1], which [description of intent or mechanism]; and (2) [dimension 2], which [description of intent or mechanism]. We further offered [type of analysis] of [module name] with respect to [key attributes, e.g., effectiveness, efficiency, explainability].

Current works usually [general statement about existing methods or approaches]. Such [specific aspect] are too [describe limitation] to offer [desired outcome or representation]. In future work, we will explore [future direction or alternative approach], in order to [goal of future research]. Furthermore, we would like to [additional future direction or research focus] to [purpose of additional work].
