\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a [brief overview of the main contribution] for [specific task or challenge]. The [main contribution] is [description of the contribution], which is derived from [theoretical background or approach]. For [further applications or models], we have introduced [algorithm or methodology name] that is based on [underlying principles or techniques used]. 

We have demonstrated how this [method/algorithm] can be applied to [mention relevant models or frameworks]. In our evaluation, we show empirically that [summarization of key findings or results] for [specific task or criterion]. Our results indicate that [general conclusion about findings], emphasizing that [importance of the approach or criterion].

Both our [theoretical insights/empirical results] support the claim that [concluding statement about the significance of the work].
