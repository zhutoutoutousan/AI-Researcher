\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work, we recognized the limitations of [existing approach/method] under [specific context/paradigm] and explored the potential of [new approach/technique] to solve these limitations. In particular, we proposed a [method/framework name] to [briefly state the purpose of the method] on [context/domain]. From the perspective of [relevant aspect], we devised [number] types of [element] from different aspects to construct the [auxiliary task/goal]. We conducted extensive experiments on [number] benchmark datasets, justifying the advantages of our proposal regarding [specific benefits or improvements].

This work represents an initial attempt to [new area of exploration] and opens up new research possibilities. In future work, we would like to [general direction for future developments]. Going beyond [current limitations or methods], we plan to explore [new perspectives/approaches] to create more [desired outcomes/effects]. Moreover, we will focus on [specific focus areas or methods], that is, to [description of pre-training and fine-tuning or similar concepts]. Another promising direction is [additional research potential or application]. We hope the development of [method/framework name] is beneficial for [general outcomes/effects on the field].
