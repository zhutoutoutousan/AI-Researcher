\section{Conclusions}

For the scenario of [research domain/area of focus], we propose a novel model named [model name]. By designing [description of key mechanisms or features], our proposed model can [explain the primary advantage or outcome], thus achieving [describe the significant improvement or results]. Our proposed model has two notable strengths: [strength 1] and [strength 2]. Therefore, the proposed model has great potential in [mention practical applications or fields]. 

In the future, we will [discuss future work plans or improvements, like incorporating new techniques or exploring additional applications]. At the same time, we will consider [mention additional directions the research might take, perhaps in real-world applications or different realms of study] which might be an interesting direction.
