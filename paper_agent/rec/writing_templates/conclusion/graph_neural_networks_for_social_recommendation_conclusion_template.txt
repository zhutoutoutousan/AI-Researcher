\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have presented a [method/module name] to [briefly describe the purpose of the method, e.g., "model [specific application/area] for [specific outcome]"]. Particularly, we provide a [adjective] approach to [explain the main contribution or innovation, e.g., "jointly capture [specific aspects] in [context]"]. Our experiments reveal that [key finding or insight regarding performance]. In addition, our [method/module name] can [describe another important feature of the method]. Experimental results on [describe datasets or scenarios used in experiments] show that [summary of comparative performance].

Currently, [discuss a limitation or scope of the current work, e.g., "we only incorporate [specific type of data or model aspects]"]. For example, [provide an example of what is missing or can be added]. Therefore, [briefly describe a future research direction related to the identified limitation]. Beyond that, [mention another limitation, such as the static nature of certain components]. Hence, [suggest another future direction that addresses this limitation].

To summarize, [restate the importance of the findings and future directions].
