\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work, we argued the [describe the main issue or challenge addressed] and performed empirical studies to justify this argument. We proposed [module name] which consists of [describe the main components of the proposed method]. Specifically, [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. 

To tackle [specific challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Formally, we define [concept] as follows: 

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

where [Detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

We conduct experiments to demonstrate the strengths of [module name] in terms of [list the advantages of the proposed method, e.g., training efficiency, generalization ability]. 

Furthermore, we believe the insights of [module name] are inspirational to future developments in [research area]. With the prevalence of [contextual statement related to increasing relevance or applications], [related models/methods] are becoming increasingly important; by explicitly exploiting [what these models/methods exploit], they can be advantageous compared to [traditional method or approaches]. 

For instance, [provide example related to the future direction or existing work]. However, these models may also suffer from [specific challenges that could arise related to existing methods]. 

To this end, we plan to explore [future direction 1] and [future direction 2]. Additionally, we propose [another potential future research direction], aiming to investigate [goal or hypothesis of the future research]. 

Finally, we will explore further the [another aspect of the proposed method or its implications], studying whether [specific question or exploration of potential application].
