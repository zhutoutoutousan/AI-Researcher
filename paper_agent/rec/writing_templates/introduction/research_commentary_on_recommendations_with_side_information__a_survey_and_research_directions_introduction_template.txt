\section{Introduction}

With the advent of [contextual trend], the [subject area] has become increasingly prevalent. [Brief explanation of the relevance and significance of the subject]. Aiming to [purpose of the study], [research area or technology] has emerged as a critical approach to address [specific challenge].

The [research area or technology] has seen substantial growth in [brief explanation of the development and importance over time]. For instance, [mention major conferences or venues where relevant research is being presented, including pertinent references].

Among different approaches in [subject area], the majority are based on [specific technique or methodology], which is recognized for its [successful aspects or advantages]. Traditional [specific techniques] typically rely on [explain core methodology], with numerous variations proposed [cite key references supporting these claims].

Despite their effectiveness, traditional [specific techniques] face fundamental challenges, namely:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [Challenge 1: Brief description of the challenge and its impacts.]
    \item [Challenge 2: Brief description of the challenge and its impacts.]
\end{itemize}

To tackle these challenges, various types of [related information types] have been employed in [relevant applications or domains] [cite supporting references]. For example, [specific example illustrating the application of side information]. This approach highlights the value of [specific information types].

Existing surveys in this domain have largely focused on [discuss the limitations of prior survey papers]. This research commentary differs by [explain how it adds uniqueness or fills gaps in existing literature].

Thus, this survey seeks to provide [aim of the survey] by examining [key aspects covered]. We aim to not only highlight [advanced methods] but also to incorporate [fundamental techniques].

\subsection{Article Collection}
To ensure comprehensive coverage of recent studies, we have collected [number of papers] papers from [list of relevant conferences or journals]. Our methodology for literature collection included [describe the search strategy and databases used].

\subsection{Contributions}
This survey makes several significant contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Contribution 1: Briefly state the first major contribution.]
    \item [Contribution 2: Briefly state the second major contribution.]
    \item [Contribution 3: Briefly state the third major contribution.]
    \item [Contribution 4: Briefly state the fourth major contribution.]
\end{enumerate}
