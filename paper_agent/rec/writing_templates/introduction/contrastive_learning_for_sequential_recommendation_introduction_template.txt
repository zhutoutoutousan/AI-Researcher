\section{Introduction}

Recommender systems have been widely employed in \textit{[insert platforms/examples]} to satisfy the users' requirements. On these platforms, \textit{[briefly describe the nature of users' interests]} which makes it difficult for platforms to make appropriate recommendations. To cope with this problem, various methods have been proposed to \textit{[describe the core challenge or task]} \cite{[cite relevant works]}.

For the \textit{[specific task or challenge]}, the essential problem is how to \textit{[explain the primary goal]} through \textit{[describe historical data or interactions]}. With these \textit{[name the representations]}, we can easily \textit{[mention the outcome, e.g., make recommendations]}. Thus, the mainline of research work seeks to derive better \textit{[user/item] representations} by using \textit{[mention powerful models or techniques]}. Recently, with the advances of \textit{[mention relevant field/technique]}, a lot of works employ \textit{[description of methods]} to handle this problem and obtain significant performance improvements \cite{[cite relevant works]}.

These models can learn effective representations by capturing \textit{[describe what patterns or complexities they capture]}. Although these methods have achieved promising results, they usually only utilize \textit{[mention task or approach]} to optimize \textit{[mention parameters or data]}. When the training data is \textit{[describe limitation]}, these methods may fail to \textit{[explain the undesirable outcome]}.

Recently, \textit{[mention breakthrough technique]} techniques have made \textit{[describe the significance of the breakthrough]} in \textit{[relevant fields]} \cite{[cite relevant works]}. Inspired by the successes of \textit{[mention relevant technique]}, we aim to use \textit{[technique]} techniques to \textit{[mention objective]} for improving \textit{[target area, e.g., recommender systems]}. 

To achieve this goal, one straightforward way could be to directly adopt \textit{[mention powerful model/approach]} on a \textit{[describe the data or corpus]}. However, this approach is not suitable for \textit{[explain the limitations or challenges]} for two reasons: (i) \textit{[first reason]} and (ii) \textit{[second reason]}.

Due to the issues mentioned before, the application of \textit{[mention technique]} in \textit{[target system]} is less well studied. The closest line of research seeks to \textit{[summarize the related research direction]} \cite{[cite relevant works]}. However, \textit{[describe gap or limitation in existing studies]}.

Different from \textit{[mention previous study focus]}, we aim to \textit{[describe the new focus or contribution]}. Specifically, we propose a novel model called \textit{[model name]} which combines \textit{[list objectives or techniques]} to achieve \textit{[describe expected outcome]}. 

Furthermore, we propose \textit{[describe data augmentation or methodology]} methods to \textit{[explain utility or purpose]} for \textit{[target user/group]}. We conduct extensive experiments on \textit{[mention datasets or conditions]}. Comprehensive experimental results verify that \textit{[model name]} achieves \textit{[mention comparative performance]} compared with competitive methods.

Our primary contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{[First contribution summary]}
    \item \textit{[Second contribution summary]}
    \item \textit{[Third contribution summary]}
