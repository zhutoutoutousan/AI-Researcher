\section{Introduction}

Low-dimensional vector embeddings of [subject/objects] in [context/scenario] have proved extremely useful as feature inputs for a wide variety of [applications/tasks] \cite{reference1, reference2, reference3, reference4, reference5}. The basic idea behind [approach/technique] is to use [method/algorithm] to distill the high-dimensional information about [related concept] into a dense vector representation. These representations can then be fed to [types of systems] and aid in tasks such as [task 1], [task 2], and [task 3] \cite{reference6, reference7, reference8}.

However, previous works have focused on [describe limitation or focus of previous methods], and many real-world applications require [specific need or capability]. This [requirement/feature] is essential for [describe context/application] that [explanation of how it operates]. An approach that facilitates [specific task/feature] also [benefits of the approach].

The [specific challenge/problem] is especially difficult compared to [related contrast/concept] because [reason for difficulty]. A [solution/approach] must [what the solution needs to achieve or address].

Most existing approaches to [related problem/technique] are inherently [type of approach]. The majority of these approaches [describe what they do] and do not naturally [describe inability]. [Mention related works and their limitations]. There are also [describe recent advances or methods relevant to the topic] that [explain their relevance or application]. In this work, we both [describe primary contributions of the study] and propose a framework that [outline the innovations].

We propose a general framework, called [framework name], for [specific task]. Unlike [previous methods], we leverage [specific elements/features] in order to [describe the goal of the intended approach]. By incorporating [elements] in the learning algorithm, we [explain the dual aspects or benefits as a result].

Instead of [previous approach], we [new approach description]. Each [new method] aggregates information from [describe the scope or depth of the method]. At [application time], we use our trained [system/tool] to [describe what it does]. Following [previous work/research], we design [approach to training] that allows [framework] to be [describe type of training]. We also [describe any additional capabilities / comparisons / improvements].

We evaluate our algorithm on [describe evaluation benchmarks], which test [outcome or ability of the method]. We use [types of datasets or scenarios] and [specific measurements] to assess [frame the goals]. Using these benchmarks, we show that our approach [describe results and comparisons]. Additionally, we [additional insights or results, highlighting key findings].

Finally, we probe the [specific aspect of the framework] and show, through [analysis method or technique], that [describe findings regarding capability/limitation].
