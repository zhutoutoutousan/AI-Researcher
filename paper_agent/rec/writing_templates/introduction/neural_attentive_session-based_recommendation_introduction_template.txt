\section{Introduction}

A user session is initiated when a user [describe initiation process]; within a user session, the user [describe interaction process]. This iterative process will continue until [clarify the end condition]. Current research in [field of study] faces challenges when [explain specific challenge], where existing methods [cite relevant works] do not perform adequately. To address this challenge, [topic of research] is proposed to [explain objective] based solely on [specify type of feedback].

\cite{Reference} [discuss foundational work or existing approach]; this model [describe the model and its process in broad terms]. Following this, [discuss improvements or variations made by other researchers, with citations]. Despite the improvements offered by approaches, [describe limitations, emphasizing critical issues left unaddressed]. Consequently, we argue that [summarize the dual considerations needed for better outcomes].

For example, consider [provide a concrete scenario that illustrates the point]. As illustrated in Figure \ref{label}, during [describe specific user behavior], the user may [describe user decision-making process]. If we were to only account for [single consideration], [explain potential pitfalls]. Hypothetically, if [provide an analogy or comparison to emphasize the need for a different approach]. Thus, we conclude that [summarize the necessity for dual consideration].

To tackle the aforementioned issue, we propose [name of proposed solution]. Specifically, [explain the core components or methodology]. This method incorporates [describe mechanism or approach], allowing us to [explain capabilities]. Leveraging the [specific technique or methodology], [detail how the methodology functions in broad terms].

The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose [state the new model or approach], which takes into account both [list the dual aspects considered] and computes [explain what is computed].
    \item We employ [name unique technique] to [explain its purpose in the research].
    \item We conducted [describe research methodology or experiments], and the results indicate that [summarize findings indicating superiority or strengths].
