\section{Introduction}

We consider the problem of [specific problem description, e.g., classifying items in a network], where [contextual information regarding the availability of data]. This problem can be framed as [specific approach or method], where [explanation of the approach with references to previous works, e.g., "as shown in previous studies (Author et al., Year)"]. 

To formalize this, we define [key concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
L = L_{\text{0}} + \lambda L_{\text{reg}} , \quad \text{with } L_{\text{reg}} = [detailed formulation relevant to the problem].
\end{equation}

Here, [explanation of terms in the equation, e.g., "$L_{\text{0}}$ denotes..."]. The formulation of [equation or concept] relies on the assumption that [assumptions made or principles used].

In this work, we [brief description of the proposed method/approach] and [explanation of how this method improves upon previous approaches, e.g., "thus avoiding..."]. This [method/approach] will allow [benefits or outcomes expected from this approach].

Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we [describe the first contribution, e.g., introducing a new method/concept] and show how it can be [explanation of the utility or application of this contribution]. Secondly, we [describe the second contribution, e.g., demonstrating effectiveness in a specific context] and provide evidence that [results or findings supporting this contribution].

Experiments on [mention datasets or contexts] demonstrate that our [proposed method/approach] [comparing affirmation, e.g., "compares favorably"] against [mention existing methods or benchmarks], both in [evaluation criteria, e.g., performance metrics] and [another evaluation criterion, e.g., efficiency].
