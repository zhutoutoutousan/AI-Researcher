\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
Matrix completion is a common formulation of [general domain or problem], where [describe the composition of the matrix and its significance]. By assuming a [principle or technique], many popular algorithms utilize [techniques or approaches] that [explain the functions or successes of these techniques].

\subsection{Challenges}
However, [identify the challenge or limitation] specific to [the current method or approach]. When [describe scenarios that exacerbate the challenge], it often requires [explain the implications of this limitation]. To address [challenge], [mention any existing approaches] have been proposed, which [briefly describe the workings of these proposals].

\subsection{Motivation}
Recently, [cite recent developments] propose [explain new concept or method], which [summarize advantages or benefits]. However, [discuss the remaining challenges or limitations]. In this paper, we propose [module name] that aims to [explain the aim of the proposed approach]. The key insight of our method is [describe the novel concept or mechanism that distinguishes your work].

\subsection{Method Overview}
To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
1. [Component 1: Brief description]
2. [Component 2: Brief description]
3. [Component 3: Brief description]

Specifically, [a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Approaches}
Furthermore, [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. Our approach [highlight unique advantages or any innovative aspects in comparison to prior work].

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
Formally, we define [concept or term] as follows:
\begin{equation}
[Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}
where [detailed explanation of each term in the equations].

\subsection{Expected Contributions}
In summary, we make the following contributions: 
1. [Contribution 1: Brief description]
2. [Contribution 2: Brief description]
3. [Contribution 3: Brief description]

This paper is structured as follows: [Outline the structure of the subsequent sections].
