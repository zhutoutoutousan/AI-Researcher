\section{Introduction}

A [research area or problem] can be viewed as [general description of the system or domain], where the input is a [description of input] and the output is a [description of output]. Given an input, the task is to [main task or goal].

One challenge in [specific area or domain], similar to [related problem/field], is to achieve both [first desired property] and [second desired property]. [First desired property] can be loosely defined as [definition or explanation], while [second desired property] is based on [definition or explanation]. [Sentence comparing the two desired properties and their implications]. In this paper, we focus on [specific application or case study], but the approach should apply to [broader applications or domains].

For [specific context, e.g., large-scale systems], [common methodologies or techniques] are widely used because they are [justification: simple, scalable, interpretable, etc.]. The methods are often trained on [description of input features]. E.g., [example illustrating a specific feature]. [Explanation of how a technique achieves one of the desired properties]. [Explanation of limitations or shortcomings of the current techniques].

[Description of alternative methods or models that address some of the limitations]. However, [discussion of challenges faced by these alternative methods]. [Illustration of the interaction between different components].

In this paper, we present [proposed method or framework] to achieve both [desired property 1] and [desired property 2] in one model, by [brief overview of how it works].

The main contributions of the paper include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [First main contribution description]
    \item [Second main contribution description]
    \item [Third main contribution description]
\end{itemize}

While [description of the simplicity or intuitive nature of the approach], we show that [key outcomes or improvements demonstrated by the proposed method].
