\section{INTRODUCTION}

To address [specific problem/challenge], [field of study or application] has become increasingly important, providing [brief overview of the purpose or technique, citation]. The essence of [field/application] lies in [core problem or function], which involves [short explanation of the task].

The prevalent approach to [specific task or problem] is to [describe common methodology], which [explain how it operates or its significance, citation]. [Name of a well-known approach or technique] is an early representative of such methods, directly linking [explain its fundamental operation, citation]. More recent studies reveal that [state a discovery or improvement], highlighting [specific improvements and their impact, citation]. In this context, these advancements can be viewed as enhancing [relevant aspect] - specifically, through the use of [describe a structural element or concept].

Building on these insights, [Name of relevant work] recently proposed [new model/approach] which achieves [type of performance] in [area of application, citation]. It draws inspiration from [related work], adhering to [specific methodology or principle]. Despite its promising results, we contend that [express a critical viewpoint or concern regarding this model]. More precisely, [describe an issue or limitation related to methodology].

To substantiate our claims, we conduct [type of study, e.g., experiments, studies] on [target model]. Through [describe the nature of your experiments/studies], we conclude that [summarize findings]. This reveals [discuss implications of findings]. Motivated by this evidence, we propose [name of your new model], which incorporates [describe the core aspect your model retains or focuses on]. Specifically, after [brief description of the process], we [explain the procedure you follow, leading to final results]. Our approach is [describe the characteristics of your model], which not only simplifies the design but also [state the practical outcomes].

In summary, this work presents the following main contributions:

- \begin{itemize}
    \item [Contribution 1: state the first main contribution or finding].
    \item [Contribution 2: state the second main contribution or finding].
    \item [Contribution 3: state the third main contribution or finding].
\end{itemize}
