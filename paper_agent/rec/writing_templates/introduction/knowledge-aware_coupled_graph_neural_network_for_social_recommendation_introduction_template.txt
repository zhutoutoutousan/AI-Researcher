\section{Introduction}

In recent years, [general topic] has attracted significant attention ([reference]). As stated in various literature ([reference]; [reference]), [key concepts] have high impacts on [related concepts] in [applications/scenarios]. Hence, researchers propose to incorporate [specific elements] into [theoretical framework] as [explanation of purpose].

The most common paradigm for state-of-the-art [specific systems] is to [explain main approach]. To tackle this problem, our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. For example, [example of application in context]. Furthermore, inspired by [recent advancements], several attempts [describe attempts and methods]. For example, [specific example].

While these solutions have provided encouraging results, several key aspects have not been well addressed yet. In particular, [first challenge statement]. For instance, [example related to challenge]. However, the majority of existing [related systems] fail to [explain failure points].

Second, [second challenge statement]. Yet, many practical scenarios may involve [describe practical diversity]. Take [specific example] as an illustration. It is crucial to [explain importance of challenge].

Third, [third challenge statement] deserves more investigation. Most recent approaches ignore [describe limitations of existing approaches]. While there exist [mention any recent work], they are limited due to [describe limitations].

While intuitively useful to integrate the above dimensions into [specific systems], [specific challenge] arises in achieving this goal. Specifically, [describe challenge specifics]. However, [another challenge statement]. Hence, how to [restate challenge] remains a significant challenge in [domain].

\textbf{The Present Work:} In light of the aforementioned motivations and challenges, we study the [specific problem] by proposing [proposed method name]. To jointly deal with [explain how method addresses the challenges], we [describe main approach towards solution]. This design enables [explain advantages of proposed method]. In addition, to capture [explain additional features of the method], we [describe additional techniques or frameworks included].

Our contributions can be highlighted as follows:
