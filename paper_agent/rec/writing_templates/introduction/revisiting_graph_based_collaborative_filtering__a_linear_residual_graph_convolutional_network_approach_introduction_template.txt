\section{Introduction}

Recent years have witnessed [describe a trend or development in the field, including citations]. The key idea of [briefly explain the core concept or methodology] is to [ explain the components or steps involved]. Therefore, [explain the significance or effectiveness of the approach, including citations]. These models demonstrate [discuss the performance or applications in relevant tasks].

As many real-world applications show [briefly describe the structure or nature of the data], [introduce the focus of the paper or the specific application]. [Explain how the proposed approach relates to the specific application]. This representation advances [discuss advantages over previous models or approaches, including citations]. Some earlier works applied [describe previous methods and their shortcomings, including citations]. These models suffered from [explain the limitations or challenges].

Recently, many researchers have directed their attention to [describe recent focus areas or trends, including citations]. For example, [provide an example that illustrates this trend or methodology]. By [explain how the specific example improves or contributes to the field], [discuss the outcomes of this approach, including citations]. These models exhibit [summarize the comparative performance or advantages over traditional methods].

Despite the relative success of [briefly acknowledge the achievements], we argue that [identify and elaborate on unresolved issues or limitations]. On one hand, [describe the first unresolved issue]. While [explain related concepts or methodologies], [pose a critical question or point]. On the other hand, [describe the second unresolved issue]. In fact, [provide rationale or examples related to this issue]. [Explain the consequences of the challenges based on the context of your research].

To tackle the above issues, we propose [introduce your proposed method or approach]. Our main contributions lie in two aspects: on one hand, [describe the first contribution and its significance]. Furthermore, [discuss the second aspect of your contribution]. [Relate the contributions to previous works or methodologies, if applicable]. Our work focuses on [specify the particular aspect of your focus or strategy]. We then show that [summarize the effectiveness of your method]. In summary, [contrast your proposed method with existing ones, focusing on scalability, training, etc.]. Finally, we perform [describe the evaluation or experiments conducted] and the results clearly show [conclude with the outcomes of your study].
