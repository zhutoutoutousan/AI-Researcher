\section{Introduction}

Recommenders aim to capture the user's preferences from different aspects of information for more accurate prediction. Learning disentangled representations that can uncover and disentangle the latent explanatory factors hidden in user behavioral data has recently been shown as an effective way to discover users' intentions, improving both recommendation accuracy and explainability. Multi-feedback, normally including the positive feedback (e.g., click) and negative feedback (e.g., unclick and dislike), is of great significance to depict the user's unbiased and various intentions. Learning disentangled representation from multi-feedback is able to capture various user intentions more accurately, leading to improvement of accuracy and explainability in recommendation.

However, learning such disentangled representation from multi-feedback that can best serve recommendation is quite challenging due to two reasons. i) Multi-feedback is complex: different types of feedback in multi-feedback data have complex relations with each other, and the relations between multi-feedback and various user intentions are also complicated. For instance, [provide example explaining a complex relation]. ii) Multi-feedback is noisy: [explain the noisy nature of multi-feedback and its implications]. As such, [describe limitations of existing methods in handling multi-feedback].

To tackle these challenges, we propose [module name] that is able to accurately discover various user intentions from different kinds of user feedback. The [module name] consists of [number] core components, i.e., [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3], which together [describe the overall function of the components]. More concretely, [provide a detailed workflow of the proposed module]. Our [unique strategy/method] then [describe how it enhances model performance]. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets to demonstrate that our proposed [module name] can significantly outperform baseline methods in terms of [metrics].

To summarize, our contributions are listed as follows. (1) We propose [module name] to [state overall goal of the module]. (2) We propose [component 1] to [describe how it addresses a specific challenge]. (3) We propose [component 2] to [explain the additional contribution made by the component].
