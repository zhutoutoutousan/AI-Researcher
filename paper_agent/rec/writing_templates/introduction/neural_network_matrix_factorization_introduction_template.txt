\section{Introduction}

We are interested in modeling [type of data or phenomenon], which arise in the analysis of [applications or contexts]. For example, in [specific application], we may have [description of entities involved], and for some collection [set notation], we have recorded the [attributes or values of interest]. The inferential goal we focus on in this work is to [describe the goal]. The data can be modeled as [description of the data structure].

One of the most popular approaches to modeling [data/context] is based on [existing methodology]. Here the idea is to assume that [explanation of the approximation]. Write [symbol notation] for the [definition of terms]. Informally, we will think of [explanation of interpretations].

[State additional methods if applicable and their definitions, keeping formal structure]. [Provide motivation or context around these methods and their applications].

Furthermore, [explain limitations or challenges of existing methods]. One way to improve upon [existing method] is to [introduce your enhancement or alternative]. In this approach, [describe how your model differs and any additional component definitions]. 

In this work, we propose [new method name] to address [specific challenge or limitation]. Our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

Specifically, we define [key concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
  [Mathematical or formal definition of the concept]
\end{equation}

To this end, [provide detailed explanations of components or steps involved in the method]. [Discuss regularization or optimization strategies used].

In summary, our contribution is [summarize the significance of the proposed method and its implications in the broader context of the field].
