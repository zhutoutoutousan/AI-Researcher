\section{INTRODUCTION}

Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next behavior by leveraging their historical behavior sequences, which has been extensively implemented in various online information systems, such as [application domains]. Unlike traditional recommendation tasks that model user preferences in a static manner, sequential recommendation effectively captures a user's evolved and dynamic preferences. For instance, [provide a relevant example illustrating the dynamism of user preferences].

Previous works have acknowledged the importance of modeling rapidly changing short-term preferences by examining the problem from three different perspectives. Specifically, [describe early efforts and their approaches]. The second category of works [mention another category] has attempted to [explain the approach], but they face challenges related to [identify specific challenges]. Recent solutions [discuss more contemporary approaches] have made strides towards addressing [highlight significant progress], yet [explain remaining difficulties]. In summary, the existing literature reveals two primary challenges in sequential recommendation that remain inadequately addressed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [First challenge description]
    \item [Second challenge description]
\end{itemize}

To tackle these challenges, we propose [module name] utilizing [method/technique] to [describe purpose]. The [specific technique or method] is applied to [explain the goal of the technique]. Specifically, we first [describe the initial step] and then [detail the subsequent actions taken within the method].

To summarize, the contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [First contribution]
    \item [Second contribution]
    \item [Third contribution]
\end{itemize}

The experimental results demonstrate [summarize results and their implications]. Further studies validate [describe any additional findings or confirmations].
