\end{figure}

Specifically, [elaborate on the key aspects of the problem, citing relevant prior work]. This connection was previously explored in [citation] and has led to [outcome or development].

Previous approaches to [problem area] have [summary of existing methods], typically [describe existing pipeline or method]. Recent advancements, however, indicate that [describe recent findings that improve the situation]. To this end, we introduce [proposed method or framework].

\subsection{[Proposed Method Title]}

We revisit [prior method] which was originally introduced in [citation] as [describe the function of the prior method]. We specifically consider [a particular setup] which [describe its advantages or functionalities].

Formally, we define [concept/definition] as follows:

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

Here, [explanation of the defined concept, including all relevant terms]. Consequently, [description of how the method works, including key components and functions].

\subsection{[Next Proposed Component Title]}

In what follows, we propose a [specific model or approach] that [describe its key innovations or strategies].

    \label{fig:[label]}
\end{figure}

This approach draws inspiration from [related technique], where [describe its relevance and functionality]. [Follow up with specific details about the proposed model, including equations or methods applicable].

\subsection{[Decoder/Output Title]}

For [specific task], we consider [describe decoding method or output generation]. The decoder produces [outcome], calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation specific to decoder]
\end{equation}

The predicted value is computed by [formal definition of prediction method].

\subsection{[Training Methodology Title]}

During model training, we minimize [loss function or optimization criterion]:

\begin{equation}
    L = [mathematical representation of the loss]
\end{equation}

where [explain what variables represent]. [Explain any important training strategies].

\subsection{[Implementation Details Title]}

In practice, we implement [technical specifications] to achieve [desired outcome or efficiency]: 

\begin{equation}
    [Vectorized or efficient implementation scheme]
\end{equation}

with [explanation of components, including any assumptions or notations].

\subsection{[Feature Representation Title]}

Features containing [description of features used] can be incorporated into the [explain how features are included]. However, [discuss any potential bottlenecks and alternatives].

\subsection{[Generalization or Regularization Title]}

To enhance generalizability, we adopt [method or strategy for regularization]:

\[ 
[description of the method] 
\]

This method is effective because [reasons supporting the effectiveness of the approach].

Finally, [conclude this section with potential implications, limitations, or future directions].
