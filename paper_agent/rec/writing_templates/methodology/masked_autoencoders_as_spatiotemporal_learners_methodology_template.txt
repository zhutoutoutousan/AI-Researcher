\section{Method}

Our method is a simple extension of [previous work/technique] to [application domain]. Our goal is to develop the method under a general and unified framework, with as little domain knowledge as possible.

\subsection{Component 1: [Component Name]}

Following [reference/similar work], given [input data type], we [describe the process or technique used]. [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

\subsection{Component 2: [Component Name]}

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of [brief description of the approach or technique]. [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module.]

\subsection{Component 3: [Component Name]}

It is hypothesized in [reference] that [hypothesis related to the problem]. Our empirical results on [data type] support this hypothesis. [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches.]

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Detailed Explanation}

[Detailed explanation of each term in the equations.]

\subsection{Conclusion of the Method}

The proposed method shows [summary of findings/implications]. Furthermore, [discuss any limitations or considerations]. The overall architecture [brief summary of the components and their interactions].

\subsection{Future Work}

To this end, we plan to [outlines future research directions or improvements].
