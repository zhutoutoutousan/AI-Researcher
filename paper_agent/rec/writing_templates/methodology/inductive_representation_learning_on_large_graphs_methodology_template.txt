\section{Proposed Method: [Method Name]}

The key idea behind our approach is that we learn [describe the main objective or insight of the proposed method]. Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. We first describe [Component 1], which [describe component 1] (Section 3.1). We then describe how [Component 2] works ([brief description]) (Section 3.2).

\subsection{[Subsection Title for Component 1]}

In this section, we describe [Component 1], which [repeat details about component 1 or its function]. [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. Specifically, we assume that we have [describe any necessary assumptions for this component].

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{[Name of Algorithm]}
\KwInput{[Input details such as data structure or parameter settings]}
\KwOutput{[Output details]}
\For{[loop condition]}{
    [Descriptive steps or operations]
}
\end{algorithm}

The intuition behind Algorithm [number] is that [explain how the algorithm progresses or the reasoning behind its steps]. [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches to highlight its advantages].

[Mathematical formulation of the key components]. Formally, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical expression]
\end{equation}

Here, [description of each term in the equations]. [Transition phrase, e.g., "To this end" or "Furthermore"], we generalize this approach to [describe generalization].

\subsection{[Subsection Title for Component 2]}

In order to learn [describe what is being learned], we apply [describe the learning process or method]. This process ensures that [explain what the learning process accomplishes]. Specifically, we [describe additional details about objectives, e.g., unsupervised vs. supervised].

\begin{equation}
    J_{G} ( z_{u} ) = [equation detailing the loss function or other relevant aspect]
\end{equation}

where [define any variables or notations used in the equation].

\subsection{[Subsection Title for Component 3]}

Unlike [comparison with known methods], we explore [describe what this section investigates]. [Explain the significance of symmetric properties, if applicable]. We examined [describe the approaches or architectures being considered]. Specifically, [detail the first approach being explored].

[Repeat this structure for additional components, if needed].

\section{Conclusion}

In summary, [summarize the key points made in the proposed method and its performance]. Our findings demonstrate that [describe the impact or significance of the proposed method in the domain].
