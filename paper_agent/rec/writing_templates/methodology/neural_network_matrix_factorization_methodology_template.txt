\section{Learning}

To learn the network weights $\theta$ and latent features $(U, V)$, we minimize the objective

\begin{equation}
\sum (n,m) \in J (X_{n,m} - \hat{X}_{n,m})^2 + \lambda \left[ \sum_n || U'_{n} ||_F^2 + \sum_n || U_{n} ||_2^2 + \sum_m || V'_{m} ||_F^2 + \sum_m || V_{m} ||_2^2 \right],
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is a regularization parameter, $|| \cdot ||_2$ denotes the $\ell_2$ norm, and $|| \cdot ||_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm. This objective can be understood as a [explanation of the mathematical relationship or theoretical underpinning].

During training, we [describe the training process, including what parameters are fixed and optimized]. [Provide details regarding the optimization technique used, including any specific algorithms or adjustments that were made]. [Mention if other algorithms were evaluated and why.]

Specifically, [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].

Furthermore, [a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module, including how different components interact].

To this end, [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches, highlighting improvements or differences].

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{definition}
[Provide a detailed definition of key concepts used in the methodology.]

Mathematically, the key components can be formulated as:
\begin{equation}
