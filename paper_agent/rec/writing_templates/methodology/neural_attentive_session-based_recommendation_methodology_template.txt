\section{METHOD}

In this section, we first introduce the [task or problem] that our study addresses. Then we describe the proposed [module name] in detail.

\subsection{[Task/Problem Description]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.] Here we provide a formalization of the [task/problem] as follows:

Let $[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$ be [describe the input parameters], where $x_i \in I (1 \leq i \leq n)$ represents [describe what $x_i$ represents]. We build a model $M$ such that, for any given input sequence, we obtain the output $y = M(x)$, where [describe the output]. We view $y$ as [describe the significance of the output], which is used for [specific applications].

\subsection{Overview}

In this paper, we propose an improved [type of model or architecture] called [module name] to address the [task/problem]. The basic idea of [module name] is to [describe the core idea]. As shown in Figure [X], the [component or feature] converts the input [data/sequence] into a set of [describe what is generated], which are fed to [next component/part] to [describe purpose]. Finally, the output is transformed by [component/operation] to produce [describe the final output].

The role of [variable or component] is to [explain the significance]. It should be noted that [additional information]. We adopt [specific approach or setting] in our model, and more details will be described in [subsection reference].

The basic idea of our work is to [briefly summarize contributions]. In the following sections, we first describe [component 1] which models [aspects] (ยง[X]). Then we introduce [component 2] which captures [aspects] (ยง[X]). Finally, we show our [module name] which combines both and computes [specific outcome] (ยง[X]).

\subsection{[Component 1]}

In the [component 1], the inputs are [describe input data] while the output is [describe output]. Both the inputs and output are uniformly represented by [describe representation].

Figure [X] shows the graphical model of [component 1]. We utilize [specific technique or model component] because [reasoning for choosing this technique]. [Include any necessary equations or formulations here.]

[Explain any relevant drawbacks or considerations regarding component 1].

\subsection{[Component 2]}

The architecture of [component 2] is similar to [component 1] as shown in Figure [X]. In this scheme, we also employ [specific technique] to [describe purpose]. To capture [concept], we involve [mechanism or technique] which allows [specific outcome or behavior].

[Mathematical formulation related to component 2 Should follow here].

This component [explain the advantages or features of component 2].

\subsection{[Main Model]}

For the task of [task/problem], the [component 1] provides [describe outcome], while [component 2] can [describe function]. We conjecture that [describe hypothesis]. Therefore, we combine [outcome 1] and [outcome 2] to form [describe the new representation].

As shown in Figure [X], [describe how components work together]. It should be noted that [explore any unique aspects of the integration].

We propose a [describe any new techniques or methods applied] which not only [describe benefits] but also [additional benefits]. Specifically, we compute [describe mathematical formulation or model].

To learn the parameters of the model, we [explain training methodology or process]. 

We employ [methodology] as the training criterion using [describe the loss function]. Finally, [explain any additional training techniques or processes].
