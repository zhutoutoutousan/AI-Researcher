\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Proposed Approach}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

\subsection{General Framework}

To permit a full treatment of [problem domain], we adopt a [describe approach] to model [describe interaction or function] as shown in Figure [number]. The input layer consists of [describe input features] that can be tailored to support various modeling approaches such as [example approaches]. 

Above the input layer is the embedding layer, which transforms the input into a dense representation. The obtained embeddings are then fed into a multi-layer architecture, which we term as [architecture name], to derive prediction scores. Each layer can be customized to reveal particular latent structures of the interactions. The final output layer generates the predicted score, and training is performed by minimizing the loss between predicted and target values. 

We formulate the predictive model as 

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{ui} = f(P^T v_U, Q^T v_I | P, Q, \Theta_f)
\end{equation}

where [explain terms and shapes of matrices] and $\Theta_f$ represents the parameters of [function]. 

\subsection{Learning the Model}

To learn the model parameters, existing methods [citation] largely perform [describe primary method or loss function]:

\begin{equation}
L_{\text{sqr}} = \sum_{(u,i) \in Y} w_{ui} (y_{ui} - \hat{y}_{ui})^2
\end{equation}

[Explain the rationale behind the chosen method]. 

Considering [specific aspect of the data], we define the likelihood function as 

\begin{equation}
p(Y | P, Q, \Theta_f) = \prod_{(u,i) \in Y} \hat{y}_{ui} \prod_{(u,j) \in Y^-} (1 - \hat{y}_{uj})
\end{equation}

By taking the negative logarithm, we arrive at the objective function, which can then be minimized using [mention optimization method].

\subsection{[Component Name]}

To illustrate [specific component], we define [describe the role of this component]. This allows us to [explain the connection to the overall methodology]. We define the mapping function as 

\begin{equation}
\phi_1(p_u, q_i) = [description of mapping or operation]
\end{equation}

with 

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{ui} = a_{\text{out}}(h^T (p_u \odot q_i))
\end{equation}

where [explain activation function or operation]. 

\subsection{Fusion of Components}

To enhance our model, we propose to combine [briefly describe methods being fused]. This combination can be expressed mathematically as 

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{ui} = \sigma(h^T [\phi_{\text{first}} \quad \phi_{\text{second}}])
\end{equation}

where [explain the significance of the combined approach]. 

\subsection{Training and Initialization}

Due to the [notable characteristic], it is important to initialize the model's parameters effectively. We propose to initialize using pre-trained [name models] which allows for improved convergence during training. 

We first train [base model] until convergence, then use its parameters to initialize the respective parts of the new model. 

For training, we optimize the model using [optimization method], ensuring that [explain any specific conditions or adjustments made].

\subsection{Conclusion}

In summary, our proposed method [summarize key contributions and findings]. Future work will explore [mention any potential continuation or improvement of the research].
