\section{Methodology}

In this section, we introduce the proposed [method name] to address [challenge] in three parts. We first introduce [base method or technique] in Section 3.1, which [describe the output or purpose]. Then, we introduce [strategy 1] and [strategy 2] in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3 respectively, which [describe how these strategies relate to the problem]. Finally, we propose [final strategy or approach] in Section 3.4 and further present the theoretical analysis and discussion in Section 3.5. The overall framework of [method name] is depicted in Figure [number].

\subsection{Base Method Description}

As mentioned in [previous section/reference], [base method or technique] produces [describe representations or outputs]. In [method name], we utilize [specific technology or method] to model [application]. Specifically, [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].

\[
[Mathematical formulation or key equations]
\]

where [explain symbols and parameters in the equations].

To capture [specific information], we adopt [loss function or technique], which [describe the purpose of the loss function]. Formally, the objective function is as follows:

\[
[Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\]

Next, we will propose [additional strategies or objectives].

\subsection{[First Strategy or Objective]}

Existing [related methods] mainly [describe limitations]. In order to [describe goal], we propose [describe the first strategy]. Formally, the [training data or representations] are defined as follows:

\[
[Mathematical formulation]
\]

With this representation, we can efficiently model [what is being modeled] as follows:

\[
[Mathematical formulation related to this strategy]
\]

And the complete [name of the objective] function is as follows:

\[
[Total formulation including all variables]
\]

where [explain any parameters].

\subsection{[Second Strategy or Objective]}

The previous strategy [describe context]. However, [identify limitations]. To [describe improvement], we extend [name of approach] to incorporate [description of the second strategy]. Specifically, we apply [describe method or technique used].

\[
[Mathematical formulation]
\]

After that, the proposed [name of the objective] is to minimize:

\[
[Mathematical formulation]
\]

where [explain terms].

\subsection{Overall Training Objective}

In this section, we introduce the overall loss and the optimization of [name]. 

Overall Training Objective. As the main target of [goal], we treat [describe how methods interact] and leverage a multi-task learning strategy to jointly train [loss functions or objectives].

\[
L = L_{1} + \lambda_1 L_{2} + \lambda_2 L_{3} + \lambda_3 \| \Theta \|_2,
\]

where [explain parameters].

\subsection{Discussion}

Novelty and Differences. For [research area], [specific observations]. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt that [describe uniqueness]. Although [discuss limitations of previous work], our work differs from them in several aspects. 

Furthermore, [expand on the discussion related to the research area]. In this work, we [describe contributions] which differs from previous works in [specific ways].
