\section{[Module Name]}

In this section, we present our [framework/approach name] for [application/task], which [briefly explain the novelty or contribution]. We first introduce the notations used in this paper and formulate the [specific problem] in Section \ref{sec:notations}. Then, a general [concept/method] is introduced in Section \ref{sec:general_method}. In Section \ref{sec:augmentation}, we propose [number] augmentation methods to construct the [specific tasks]. In Section \ref{sec:model}, we introduce the [model type or architecture] utilized in our approach. Finally, we propose how to train the [model type] via a [training strategy].

\subsection{Notations and Problem Statement}
\label{sec:notations}

In this paper, we represent [type of data] by [notation style]. Let [symbol] denote [definition], where [symbol] and [symbol] denote [relevant dimensions or characteristics]. 

Based on the above notations, we now define the task for [task name]. It focuses on [brief description of the target of the task]. It can be formulated as follows:

\[
[y^{\ast}] = [mathematical expression]
\]

\subsection{[General Method] Framework}
\label{sec:general_method}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we explore applying [concept/technique] to [specific application]. The framework comprises [number] major components, including [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

\subsubsection{[Component 1]}
\label{sec:component1}

[Description of component 1, including its purpose and functioning. Use multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind this component.]

\subsubsection{[Component 2]}
\label{sec:component2}

[Description of component 2, detailing how it interacts with other components and its significance.]

\subsubsection{[Component 3]}
\label{sec:component3}

Finally, we apply a [type of function/algorithm] to [objective of this component]. The loss function [name/notation] can be defined as follows:

\[
L_{[name]} = [mathematical formulation]
\]

\subsection{[Augmentation Method] Operators}
\label{sec:augmentation}

Based on the above [framework/concept], we next discuss the design of the transformations in the [context]. As shown in [referencing figure], we introduce [number] basic augmentation approaches that can [function of augmentations].

\subsubsection{[First Augmentation Method]}
\label{sec:augmentation1}

[Description of the first augmentation method, including its formulation and motivation.]

\[
y = a_{first}(x) = [mathematical expression]
\]

\subsubsection{[Second Augmentation Method]}
\label{sec:augmentation2}

[Description of the second augmentation method, including its formulation and motivation.]

\[
y = a_{second}(x) = [mathematical expression]
\]

\subsubsection{[Third Augmentation Method]}
\label{sec:augmentation3}

[Description of the third augmentation method, including its formulation and motivation.]

\[
y = a_{third}(x) = [mathematical expression]
\]

\subsection{[Model Name]}
\label{sec:model}

In this subsection, we describe how we model [data/task] using [model architecture]. The [model type] consists of [number] key layers, including [layer types or components].

\subsubsection{[Layer Type 1]}
[Description of the first layer/component and its role in the model. This may include formulation.]

\[
h_{i} = [mathematical expression]
\]

\subsubsection{[Layer Type 2]}
[Description of the second layer/component and its significance.]

\[
h_{i} = [mathematical expression]
\]

\subsubsection{[Layer Type 3]}
[Description of the third layer/component included in the model.]

\[
h_{i} = [mathematical expression]
\]

\subsection{Training Strategy}
[Provide a brief overview of how the training is conducted, specifying loss functions and the multi-task learning approach if applied.]

\[
L_{total} = L_{main} + \lambda L_{[additional loss]}
\]

The main loss function for the task can be defined as follows:

\[
L_{main}(x) = -\log\frac{[expression]}{[expression]}
\]
