\section{Methodology}

In this section, we present the [Proposed Method Name] framework to [primary objective or goal] based on [underlying principles or techniques]. We introduce the critical components that differentiate [Proposed Method Name] from [previous approaches or techniques].

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Briefly, [provide a brief description of the general problem]. [A description of key components or processes in the existing methods]. Formally, we define [concept or problem] as follows:

Let [Define variables and parameters]. The goal of [Problem Type] is to [restate the objective formally].

Despite [mention any existing challenges], there has been [describe the gap or deficiency]. To address this gap, we propose [Proposed Method Name] to [intended impact or improvement].

[Proposed Method Name]. The overall architecture of [Proposed Method Name] is illustrated in Figure [X]. Its core idea lies in [describe the foundational concept]. We introduce a [specific strategy or component] with [contextual reference].

\subsection{Design of [Proposed Method Name]}

In this part, we explore how to design [Proposed Method Name] to match and [funtionality or performance goal]. Specifically, we discuss different strategies via addressing the following questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Q1: [Question 1 about the method/design]
    \item Q2: [Question 2 about training or robustness]
    \item Q3: [Question 3 about architecture]
    \item Q4: [Question 4 about performance criteria]
\end{itemize}

These questions concern the designs of [list relevant aspects] in [Proposed Method Name], enabling us to develop [Proposed Method Name].

Q1: [First research question or design consideration]. [Discuss different options or existing approaches]. Thus, we adopt [solution or strategy] as our primary objective.

Q2: [Second research question or design consideration]. [Explain challenges and significance]. To tackle this, we propose [specific strategy or approach] for [objective].

Q3: [Third research question or design consideration]. The [component or process] maps [describe input to output]. [Justify the choice and discuss its benefits compared to alternatives].

Q4: [Fourth research question or design consideration]. The criterion for [describe the output or evaluation metric] varies [contextual considerations]. [Discuss the proposed method for evaluation and justification for choice].

\begin{equation}
    L_{\text{criterion}} = [Insert appropriate equations here],
\end{equation}
which is defined [provide definition in context].

In summary, [Proposed Method Name] is a [describe characteristics, e.g., scalable, efficient, etc.]. Figure [X] illustrates how each design choice impacts the overall performance.

\subsection{Training and Inference}

The overall training flow of [Proposed Method Name] is summarized in Figure [X]. First, [describe the initial training setup]. We feed [context of input] into the [component] to generate [describe generated outputs]. During [specific stage of training], we [describe mechanism or technique used]. 

For downstream applications, the [component] is applied to [describe inference setup]. The [output from process] can be used for [list potential applications]. [Discuss any additional techniques or frameworks utilized for performance]. In the experiments, we show that [summarize key performance outcomes].
