\section{[Title of the Methodology Section]}

As stated earlier, most of existing methods focus on [aspect or layer], while overlook [another aspect]. Motivated by this observation, in this paper, we focus on [main focus of the paper] utilizing [proposed method/approach] to address [specific challenge].

The [proposed method] consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. In this section, we elaborate each of these three components in detail. Figure \ref{fig:example} provides a depiction of our proposed [framework/model].

\subsection{[Component 1 Title]}

\subsubsection{[Sub-component 1 Title]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the sub-component. Include definitions and key ideas.]

Based on these insights, we construct [describe the structure or model relating to the sub-component]. Specifically, we define [related concept or framework] as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical formulation of the key components related to the sub-component]
\end{equation}

Where [explain the terms in the equation or the formulation in detail].

\subsubsection{[Sub-component 2 Title]}

[Continue detailing the sub-component. Use multiple sentences to lay out the reasoning and methodology.]

Informed by [relevant previous work/technique], we propose [specific method/approach] that aims to tackle [specific problem]. This method involves [describe the key aspects and workflow].

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical formulation of key processes]
\end{equation}

To illustrate this process, we present [specific examples or illustrations as needed].

\subsection{[Component 2 Title]}

[Begin by providing an overview of the second main component and its significance.]

We aim to address [specific challenge] through [method]. To this end, we utilize a [describe the approach used in this component].

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches, highlighting its advantages or novelty.]

\subsection{[Component 3 Title]}

[Start with a brief introduction to the final component and its importance.]

This component deals with [specific issues or areas], integrating [describe methodology]. The details of this process can be formally expressed as:

\begin{equation}
[Key mathematical formulations related to this component]
\end{equation}

As previously outlined, to effectively implement this methodology, we require [explain dependencies, assumptions, or prerequisites].

\subsection{Complexity Analysis}

To evaluate the efficiency of our method, we analyze the [specify aspects like time complexity, space complexity, etc.] for [aspect of the system]. Specifically, the time complexity for [describe the scenario in terms of key parameters] is:

\begin{equation}
[Insert complexity formulation]
\end{equation}

With this analysis, we can showcase the scalability of our proposed method when applied to [context or application domain]. 

[Conclude this section by summarizing the importance of adopting the proposed approach and its implications in the research field.]
