\section{Module Name}

Before delving into the specific details, we first present the research problem, foundational concepts, and notations used throughout this paper.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

In [research domain], let \( U = \{ u_{1}, u_{2}, \ldots, u_{|U|} \} \) denote a set of [entity type], \( V = \{ v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{|V|} \} \) be a set of [another entity type], and [list notation] represent the interaction sequence for [entity type] \( u \in U \). Given the interaction history [interaction sequence], the goal of this study is to predict [specific prediction task]. This can be formally defined as determining the probability [formulation].

\subsection{Model Architecture}

Here, we introduce a new model called [model name], which utilizes [technique or approach] for [specific task]. The model is designed based on [relevant architecture or concept].

As illustrated in [figure reference], [model name] is structured with [number] [layer type]. At each layer, [description of layer operation] allowing [key feature]. Unlike [existing method], our model adopts [unique method or technique], resulting in [benefit or advantage]. Furthermore, [comparison with existing methods].

\subsection{Core Layer}

As illustrated in [figure reference], given an input sequence of length [length], we compute [hidden representation] across each layer for each position through [layer description]. The [layer type] consists of [sub-layers] that accomplish [task/goal].

\subsubsection{Attention Mechanism}

The [attention mechanism type] plays a crucial role in this model. Previous work has demonstrated [benefit or justification for mechanism]. Therefore, we implement [specific mechanism] as follows: [mechanism description].

\subsubsection{Feed-Forward Network}

To enhance the model's expressiveness, we integrate a [network type] to the outputs of the attention layer, characterized by [network description].

\subsubsection{Layer Stacking}

To improve [aspect of model], we stack [layer type], allowing for [specific reasoning]. However, deeper networks can be challenging to train. Thus, we introduce [training technique] to stabilize the training process.

\subsection{Embedding Layer}

To utilize the sequential information of the input, we incorporate [embedding technique] into the inputs of [layer type]. Specifically, for each input item, we define the representation as follows: [embedding formulation].

\subsection{Output Layer}

After processing through [number] layers, we obtain the final output [output description], where we apply [output technique] to yield [output prediction method].

\subsection{Model Learning}

\subsubsection{Training}

In conventional models, the training objective typically involves [common objective in the domain]. However, we propose to use [new objective] for our training, which entails [description of training method].

\subsubsection{Testing}

To align with the [final task], we adjust the training setup by [adjustment method]. This ensures [justification for adjustment].

\subsection{Discussion}

In this section, we discuss the relationship of our model with previous work in the field.

\subsubsection{Comparison with Related Work}

[Related work 1] is notably different since [description of differences]. 

[Related work 2] shares similarities with our approach, particularly in [commonality] but diverges in [key differences].

In summary, [discussion of how proposed work fits within the broader field].
