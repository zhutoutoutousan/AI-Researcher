\section{METHOD}

The former section demonstrates that [describe the main challenge]. Driven by these findings, we set the goal of developing [short description of the proposed method] to address [challenge]. The advantages of this approach are severalfold - [list advantages, e.g., being more interpretable, easier to train, etc.].

In this section, we first present our designed [module name], as illustrated in [Figure/Table reference]. We then provide an in-depth analysis to show the rationale behind its design. Lastly, we describe how to implement [describe implementation process or model training].

\subsection{[Module Name]}

The basic idea of [related method/concept] is to [explain the core function or goal]. To achieve this, it performs [describe the main operation or process]. Such can be abstracted as:

\begin{equation}
[equation representing core relation].
\end{equation}

[Provide necessary definitions or concepts related to the equation]. Many works have [discuss existing approaches], but [discuss the limitations of existing approaches].

\subsubsection{[Submodule Name]}

In [specific module], we adopt [describe the approach taken] and abandon [mention techniques abandoned]. The operation in [module name] is defined as:

\begin{equation}
[equation representing the operation].
\end{equation}

[Provide explanation and motivation for the components of the equation].

It is important to note that [discuss specific aspects of the design or operation].

\subsubsection{[Next Component Name]}

In [module name], the main parameters are [describe relevant parameters]. When set, [explain how the outputs are derived]. After [number] layers, we combine the outputs to form [describe what is formed]:

\begin{equation}
[equation for the combination of layers].
\end{equation}

Where [explain the significance of parameters, etc.]. The reasons for this combination are [list reasons, e.g., preventing over-smoothing, capturing different semantics, etc.].

The final prediction model is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = [describe prediction equation].
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{[Matrix Formulation Name]}

We provide the matrix form of [module name] to facilitate implementation. Let [describe interaction matrix and its dimensions]. Thus, we obtain [describe the derived matrix form]:

\begin{equation}
[equation representing the matrix form].
\end{equation}

Where [define important terms and matrices used].

\subsection{Model Analysis}

We conduct model analysis to demonstrate the rationale behind the design of [module name]. First, we discuss [relation with existing models or theories]. This analysis shows that [summarize findings]. 

Next, we analyze [describe further relations with other models]. This highlights the connection between [discuss key elements].

\subsubsection{[Specific Relation Name]}

In [cite relevant work], [explain argument or findings from that work]. We simplify [explain the simplification process]. Following that, we can express [state findings in simpler terms].

\subsubsection{[Another Relation Name]}

In [cite another relevant work], the approach [describe the approach and its implications]. By comparing with [existing model or technique], we unveil how [summarize key findings].

\subsubsection{[Further Analysis]}

Through our analysis, we uncover [deduce insights from the analysis]. Here, we analyze [discuss another aspect].

\subsection{Model Training}

The trainable parameters of [module name] are [list parameters]. We utilize [describe loss function used] to [explain purpose of training].

\begin{equation}
L = [loss function representation].
\end{equation}

Where [define any regularization, strategies, etc.]. We employ [mention optimization method], and [describe any sampling strategies].

We acknowledge that [discuss any limitations or deviations from common practices]. This illustrates [highlight advantages].

Moreover, we can also [discuss potential future improvements or variations of the model]. However, [mention findings that lead to the conclusion or decision made].

[Summarize the model training strategy and anticipated outcomes].
