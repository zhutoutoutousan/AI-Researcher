\section{Methodology}

We describe our method under the setting of [specific application/domain] \cite{reference1}, whereas the idea is generally applicable to [related techniques/tasks]. The [specific structure] is represented as [mathematical representation] where [N] is the number of [specific items]. The main consideration of our work is that each [specific item] is described by [features] where [specific condition]. We summarize the symbols used in the paper in Table \ref{table:terms}.

\subsection{Overall Framework}

The target of [Method Name] is to [goal of the methodology] in a [description of method style]. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:framework}, [Method Name] separately exploits [description of components]. Specifically, [multiple sentences explaining the overall procedure].

In particular, we first [description of the initial process], which is formulated as:

\begin{equation}
    [Equation for initial process]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of variables]. [Additional details about the implementation and any assumptions]. 

Similar to [related methods], [Method Name] is learned in an end-to-end manner by optimizing an objective function:

\begin{equation}
    L = [Mathematical expression for the objective function]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of components within the expression]. In the following, we introduce the [specific process to be detailed next].

\subsection{[Submodule Title]}

Inspired by [previous work], [Method Name] focuses on [specific goal]. To thoroughly capture [specific aspect], our first belief is that [underlying principle]. Here, we consider [list of factors or components]. 

To bridge this gap, [Method Name] integrates [components] into [specific process]. Specifically, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:framework}, [Method Name] consists of three main modules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{[Module 1 Title]}: [Description of Module 1]
    \item \textbf{[Module 2 Title]}: [Description of Module 2]
    \item \textbf{[Module 3 Title]}: [Description of Module 3]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{[Title of Specific Submodule]}

For [Specific Submodule], [explanation of the process]. For example, [example or application]. [Mathematical formulation relevant to this part].

\begin{equation}
    [Equation for specific submodule]
\end{equation}

which [explanation of the equation]. This method [explanation of benefits/complexity].

\subsubsection{[Title of Another Specific Submodule]}

Distinct from [another submodule], the purpose of [Yet Another Submodule] is to [goal of the submodule]. In real scenarios, [specific context]. Therefore, we need to [aim or task] through [methodology or technique].

Supplying details about [specific characteristics or structures]. Formally, this can be described as follows:

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical expression for this submodule]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Further Components}

Aiming to [overall aim related to individual modules], [Method Name] fuses [descriptions of components] into [overall process] through an aggregation layer. As such, the aggregation layer is also responsible for [additional responsibilities].

Here we perform a [description of strategy]:

\begin{equation}
    h' = [Mathematical representation of final representation]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of hyperparameters or final notes about this section].

\subsection{Conclusion}

In this section, we outlined the core methodology of [Method Name], detailing its significant components and underlying principles. Future work may focus on [ideas for extension or improvement related to the method].
