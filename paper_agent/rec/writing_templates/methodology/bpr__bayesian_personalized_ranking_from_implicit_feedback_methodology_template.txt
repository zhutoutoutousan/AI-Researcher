\section{[Main Topic Name]}

In this section, we derive a generic method for addressing the [specific task]. Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. Our approach consists of the general optimization criterion for [task], denoted as $\mathcal{OPT}$, which will be derived through [methodological approach, e.g., Bayesian analysis]. We demonstrate the analogies to [relevant concepts or metrics]. 

For learning models with respect to $\mathcal{OPT}$, we propose the algorithm $\mathcal{Learn}$, which [brief description of the learning algorithm]. We will further illustrate how $\mathcal{OPT}$ and $\mathcal{Learn}$ can be applied to [describe applications to state-of-the-art methods].

\subsection{[Subtopic Name]}

\subsubsection{[Loss Functions]}

To complete the [methodological approach], we introduce a general prior density $p(\Theta)$, which is [describe the prior]. Formally, we express this as:
\begin{equation}
p(\Theta) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma_\Theta).
\end{equation}

Next, we set $\Sigma_\Theta = \lambda_\Theta I$ to reduce the number of unknown hyperparameters. Now we can formulate the maximum posterior estimator to derive our generic optimization criterion for [task], defined as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{OPT} := [Mathematical formulation of the key components].
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{[Analogies to Relevant Concepts]}

With this formulation of the [Main Topic], the analogy between [Concept 1] and [Concept 2] becomes clear. For instance, [provide definition or formulation for Concept 1]. 

The average [relevant measure] can be stated as:
\begin{equation}
\text{Average Metric} := \frac{1}{|U|} \sum_{u \in U} [Metric] (u).
\end{equation}

This comparison shows that [highlight the significant differences].

\subsection{[Learning Algorithm Name]}

In the previous section, we derived an optimization criterion for [task]. As the criterion is [characteristic of the criterion], [type of algorithm] are an obvious choice for maximization. However, we propose $\mathcal{Learn}$, a [description of the proposed algorithm].

The gradient of $\mathcal{OPT}$ with respect to the model parameters is given by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{OPT}}{\partial \Theta} = [Gradient expression].
\end{equation}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Algorithm $\mathcal{Learn}$}
\KwInput{[Inputs to the algorithm]}
\KwOutput{[Outputs of the algorithm]}
\textbf{initialize} $\Theta$\\
\Repeat{[Convergence condition]}{
    [Processing steps]
    Update $\Theta$ accordingly\\
}
Return $\hat{\Theta}$\\
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{[Application to Specific Models]}

We describe how our proposed BPR methods can be used to learn two state-of-the-art model classes for [specific application area]. We have chosen [specific model type 1] and [specific model type 2], both striving to [describe the task of these models]. 

We first define [discuss one model's prediction]. Our optimization seeks to [objective of the optimization]. Hence, we decompose [related mathematical definition].
