\subsection{Definitions and Notations}

Let $U = \{ u_{1}, u_{2}, \ldots, u_{n} \}$ and $V = \{ v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{m} \}$ be the sets of users and items respectively, where $n$ is the number of users, and $m$ is the number of items. We assume that $R \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ is the user-item rating matrix. If $u_{i}$ gives a rating to $v_{j}$, then $r_{ij}$ is the rating score, otherwise we employ $0$ to represent the unknown rating. The mathematical notations used in this paper are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:notation}.

\subsection{An Overview of the Proposed Framework}

The architecture of the proposed model is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:model}. The model consists of three components: [Component 1], [Component 2], and [Component 3]. [A paragraph explaining the purpose and interactions between these components].

\subsection{[Component 1 Name]}

[Component 1 introductory statement highlighting goals and challenges]. To address this challenge, we utilize [Describe the methodology or approach used]. The mathematical formulation is defined as follows:

where [Explain the variables and functions involved].

\subsection{[Component 2 Name]}

[Component 2 introductory statement with goals and challenges]. Again, we adopt a similar approach by [Describe methodology or approach]. The corresponding formulation can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}

where [Explain the variables and functions involved].

\subsection{Learning [Specific Type] Factors}

To learn [Type of factors/questions addressed], we integrate the information from [Explain the sources of information]. This leads to the formulation:

\begin{equation}
[Insert final equation here]

where we assume [Assumptions/conditions].

\subsection{Training and Optimization}

To estimate the model parameters, we need to specify an objective function. Commonly, this is formulated as:

\begin{equation}
