\section{Proposed Method}

In this section, we propose [Method Name], which is a [general description of method type] for [purpose or application].

\end{figure}

The overall architecture of [Method Name] is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:[figure_label]}. [Method Name] advances current [field/technique] with two key characteristics: (1) [First characteristic], and (2) [Second characteristic].

\subsection{Embedding Propagation}

Given [context or formulation], let [Variables] denote [description of variables]. Then, [Method Name] takes [input description]:

\begin{equation}
    [Equation Placeholder]
    \label{eq:[equation_label]}
\end{equation}

Notably, [describe any important differences or features from existing methods].

Following the theoretical elegance of [related work], at each iteration step [iteration relation], we assume that [Mathematical relationship]. Specifically, we express this as:

\begin{equation}
    [Equation Placeholder]
    \label{eq:[equation_label]}
\end{equation}

where [description of each term and its significance].

\subsection{Preference Prediction}

With a predefined structure of [depth or parameters], the [process description] would occur until [termination condition].

For each [user/item], [description of how preferences are captured or predicted]. Then, the predicted preference can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    [Equation Placeholder]
    \label{eq:[equation_label]}
\end{equation}

where [define notation and meaning].

In practice, most [related techniques] achieve the best performance with [parameter settings]. The overall trend indicates that [describe performance trends].

Based on [observations/conclusions], we argue that: [Main argument or hypothesis].

We can express this preference prediction function as:

\begin{equation}
    [Equation Placeholder]
    \label{eq:[equation_label]}
\end{equation}

This formulation captures [explanation of significance].

\subsection{Model Learning}

By integrating [previous equation], we derive:

\begin{equation}
    [Equation Placeholder]
    \label{eq:[equation_label]}
\end{equation}

where [detailed description of components and their interactions].

To optimize performance, we adopt [loss function description] as:

\begin{equation}
    \text{min } \Theta L(R, \hat{R}) = [Loss Function Components]
    \label{eq:[loss_equation_label]}
\end{equation}

where [explanation of loss function components, variables and significance].

Lastly, we define [training data description or any other relevant content].
