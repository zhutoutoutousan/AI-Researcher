\subsection{[Component 1 Name]}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [component 1 name] to address [challenge]. The [component 1 name] is a [description of the model/approach], as illustrated in Figure [X] ([position]). The output, denoted as [output variable], is formulated as follows:

\begin{equation}
[output variable] = [function or model representation]
\end{equation}

Here, [explanation of input variables], where [variable set] is a collection of [description]. One of the critical elements of the [component 1 name] involves [important transformation or technique], which is defined as:

\begin{equation}
[\text{transformation name}] = [transformation formula]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of transformation]. This allows [reason why transformation is important].

\subsection{[Component 2 Name]}

To tackle [challenge], our method introduces the [component 2 name], which is a [description of component 2]. Specifically, [overview of how component 2 functions]. The original inputs are [description], converted into [type of representation], enabling [reason for conversion].

The computation in the [component 2 name] follows the process:

\begin{equation}
a^{(l+1)} = f(W^{(l)} a^{(l)} + b^{(l)})
\end{equation}

where [explanation of variables]. Here, [details about the activation function or model behavior].

\subsection{[Joint Component Name]}

The [component 1 name] and [component 2 name] are combined through [method of combination] to generate the final output. It is crucial to differentiate between [joint training/other method] and [comparison method]. [Explanation of the distinction and its implications].

Specifically, [details of the joint training process]. The optimization employs [description of optimization technique], ensuring simultaneous [description of how components are optimized].

The complete model can be represented as follows:

\begin{equation}
P(Y = 1 | x) = [function representation]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of the components in the equation]. In this formulation, [description of important variables and their roles].
