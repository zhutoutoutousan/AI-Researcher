\section{Preliminaries and Related Work}

In this section, we introduce the basic definition of [general topic/concept] and review the recent developments on [relevant field/technique]. We also highlight the differences between [proposed method] and existing attempts in [domain of study].

\subsection{[First Subtopic]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the importance and background of the subtopic. Introduce the concept and any key definitions.]

\begin{definition}
[Definition number]. [Concept Name]: [Formal definition of the concept].
\end{definition}

[Additional definitions or clarifications as needed.]

\textbf{[Key Concept related to the subtopic].} [Explain this key concept and provide examples if necessary.]

[Discuss another key element or idea related to the subtopic, ideally with further definitions.]

There have been significant lines of research on [briefly list research areas related to this subtopic], while [highlight aspects that have not been extensively studied].

\subsection{[Second Subtopic]}

[Introductory sentences describing the relevance of this subsection to the main topic.]

Recently, [brief context about advancements in the relevant field]. Generally, [description of a generalized framework or approach relevant to the field]. Formally, this can be defined as follows:

\begin{definition}
[Definition number]. [Framework/Method Name]: [Formal description of the method or framework].
\end{definition}

[Discuss the methodology, providing necessary mathematical formulations.]

\textbf{[Key operators or components in the method].} [Explain their roles and functionality.]

[Provide several sentences comparing various existing methods and their contributions within the framework. Mention sources where applicable.]

Various [types of methodologies/approaches] have been proposed following this [framework/methodology]. [List examples with brief explanations.]

\subsection{[Third Subtopic]}

[Introduce the subtopic with relevant context and implications for the field.]

Recent studies have attempted to [describe the efforts made in extending or improving existing techniques]. [Name and briefly describe key studies that contribute to this subtopic.]

Though these methods have shown [summarize the empirical results], [discuss limitations or gaps in the existing literature].

To address this, we propose [new method/approach] to consider [describe how your method improves upon existing methods]. [Explain the rationale and insights behind the proposed method.]

To summarize, the key differences between [proposed method] and existing attempts include:

- (1) [First key difference and its implications.]
- (2) [Second key difference and its implications.]
- (3) [Third key difference and its implications.]
- (4) [Fourth key difference and its implications.]
