\section{RELATED WORK}

The idea of [general concept/approach] is inspired by previous work, such as [referenced work or technique], which [briefly explain contribution]. In this paper, we propose [module name] to address [challenge] by [explanation of method and its advantages].

In the context of [specific domain], [mention relevant techniques or approaches] has been shown to [describe the impact], facilitating [specific outcomes]. For instance, [specific example of a method or technique] has been implemented to [describe functionality or benefit]. Furthermore, [another technique or approach] has been utilized to [explain contribution], leading to [specific advantage or outcome]. 

In the literature on [related area], [discuss existing methods or frameworks]. Notably, [reference to a particular work or method], has explored [specific aspects]. Different from these methods, our approach [describe how your approach differs and its significance]. 

To tackle [specific challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Specifically, we define [concept or term] as follows:
\begin{equation}
   [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

We expand upon each term in the equation, with [detailed explanation of each term]. 

In summary, [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches], highlighting [key advantages or unique aspects of the proposed work].
