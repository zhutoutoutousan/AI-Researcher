\section{Related Work}

Research in this domain has significantly evolved over the years. Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Component 1]
    \item [Component 2]
    \item [Component 3]
\end{itemize}

Specifically, [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. 

Furthermore, [a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

To this end, we compare our approach with existing methods. [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. 

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

Moreover, we provide a detailed explanation of each term in the equations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Explanation of term 1]
    \item [Explanation of term 2]
    \item [Explanation of term 3]
\end{itemize}
