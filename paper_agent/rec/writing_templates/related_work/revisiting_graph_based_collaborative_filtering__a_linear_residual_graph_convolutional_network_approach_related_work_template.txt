\section{Related Work}

In the domain of [general topic], there are two primary sets of entities: a [entity set description] with [number of entities] ( |[entity set name]| = [M] ) and an [item set description] ( |[item set name]| = [N] ). As [common form or challenge] is prevalent in many [context related to the topic], we focus on [specific focus of the paper] in this paper ([citation]). It is straightforward to extend the proposed model for [other application]. Entities exhibit [description of interaction] with a [matrix or structure] $\mathbf{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$, with $r_{ai} = 1$ indicating that [entity description] has a [relationship type] with [item description], otherwise it equals 0. Accurately learning the [key components or matrices] is crucial to achieving [desired outcome or performance metric].

Earlier works primarily concentrated on [description of earlier approaches] ([citation]; [citation]). [Next generation methodology], such as [specific models or techniques] ([citation]; [citation]), modeled the interaction between [entity description] and [item description] using [methodology description].

With the significant success of [emerging technique], researchers began to [describe the new approach adopted] and adapted [same/emerging technique] for [specific application] ([citation]; [citation]; [citation]). Earlier models employing [specific theoretical foundation or technique] faced challenges relating to [describe the challenges encountered in earlier models] ([citation]; [citation]). More recent approaches in this realm have focused on [description of recent trends] ([citation]; [citation]; [citation]; [citation]). [Specific model] was designed for [specific recommendation type] under the [type of methodology], with [input features description] ([citation]). [Additional relevant models] are particularly crafted under the [specific setting]. 

Given [description of relationship matrix], the [entity-item graph] can be denoted as $\mathcal{G} = \langle [set descriptions], [adjacency description] \rangle$, where [description of the adjacency construction].

Let $\mathbf{E} \in \mathbb{R}^{(M + N) \times D}$ represent the [description of embedding matrix]. By feeding the embedding matrix $\mathbf{E}$ into [specific models] with the graph $\mathcal{G}$, i.e., $\forall i \in [entity and item set], h^0_i = e_i$. Consequently, [specific models] iteratively perform [description of iterative method] and [nonlinear transformation description], allowing embeddings of [entities or items] to be updated throughout the process. Ultimately, the final embedding $\mathbf{H}^K$ explicitly integrates [description of collective connections]. All parameters (including the [initial matrix] and [other parameters]) can be learned in a [method of training]. [Specific model or variant] can be seen as a special case of [another related model] with [specific conditions].
