\section{Related Work}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

Specifically, [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. 

Furthermore, [a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

To establish context, we first summarize the relevant literature in the domain. 

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Auto-encoders]}

Auto-encoders, such as [reference to specific models or works], represent a recent class of state-of-the-art models that can be seen as [general description or relationship to proposed work]. For instance, [a specific model] is the first such implementation where [description of process or method]. 

In contrast to [specific aspect of proposed method], [given model] does [description of what it does differently]. Note that in [another approach], [additional specific detail about its methodology]. 

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Factorization Models]}

Many popular approaches in collaborative filtering are based on [general concept, e.g., matrix factorization]. These methods assume [basic assumption or principle behind the approach]. For instance, [reference and description of a specific model]. 

In this context, [comparison of different approaches or enhancements], where [explanation of what they improve upon]. Another notable method, [name of another method], [explanation of its unique contribution]. 

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Matrix Completion with Side Information]}

Matrix completion techniques focus on [general goal and methodology]. Notably, [reference to foundational work] transformed the challenge of [describe challenge] by [general approach taken]. 

Building on this, [discuss next model and how it incorporates additional information]. For example, [description of methods and their contributions]. Most recently, [recent work], distinguishes itself by [description of its approach in contrast to yours]. 

Overall, [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. 

To formally define our contributions, we provide [mathematical formulation of the key components]:

\begin{equation}
[Insert equation here]
\end{equation}

Wherein each term is defined as follows: [Detailed explanation of each term in the equations]. 

In conclusion, [summarization of the differences or enhancements offered by your approach relative to the existing literature].
