\section{Related Work}

Existing work in the field of [research domain] can be broadly categorized into [group 1], [group 2], [group 3], and [group 4].

\subsection{[Group 1]}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. Existing [group 1 methods] primarily focus on [describe focus of the group, e.g., first-order connectivity], utilizing [specific techniques or methods used in this group]. For instance, [example method] [briefly explain its approach and how it relates to [group 1]]. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they [mention limitations, e.g., fail to capture higher-order connections]. 

Moreover, [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. 

\subsection{[Group 2]}

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

In contrast, [group 2 methods] [describe group 2 methods and their approach]. For example, [example method from group 2] [describe how it works]. However, [highlight limitations and challenges faced by group 2 methods, e.g., issues with scalability or transferability].

\subsection{[Group 3]}

[Group 3 methods] draw inspiration from [specific technique or approach] and have shown promising results in [describe results]. For instance, [example method from group 3] employs [describe key approaches used]. 

Nevertheless, these approaches [discuss limitations, such as difficulties in training or performance issues].

\subsection{[Group 4]}

[Group 4 methods] are based on [describe foundational concepts, e.g., GNNs or neural network architectures]. Typically, they [general approach of group]. For example, [example method from group 4] utilizes [describe its unique features]. 

Notably, these methods ["highlight any unique contributions or differences compared to other groups, e.g. relational modeling, preserving dependencies, etc."].

Thus, to the best of our knowledge, [state a general conclusion about the gaps or unexplored areas in existing work].
