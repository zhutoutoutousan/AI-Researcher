\section{Related Work}

Our method is conceptually related to previous [field/domain] approaches, [specific previous techniques/algorithms], and recent advancements in [specific area of research]. 

\subsection{Previous Approaches}
There are a number of recent [type of approaches] that [explain what these approaches do] [Citations]. These methods also bear close relationships to [older classic methods] as well as [specific algorithms/theories]. Since these [approaches] [explain inherent limitations], they [describe additional requirements or issues]. One notable exception to this trend is the [exceptional method] introduced by [Author(s)] [Citations], which [describe unique characteristics of the exceptional method]. However, [discuss how your method differs].

\subsection{Supervised Learning in [Relevant Context]}
Beyond [previous category], there is a rich literature on [describe broader topic]. This includes a wide variety of [types of methods], where [describe how features are derived] [Citations]. There are also a number of recent [type of methods] for [specific tasks] [Citations]. Our approach is conceptually inspired by several of these algorithms. However, whereas these previous approaches [describe what they focus on], the focus of this work is [explain your focus].

\subsection{Innovations in [Specific Technology or Approach]}
In recent years, several [specific technology/approach] for [application] have been proposed [Citations]. The majority of these methods [explain limitations]. However, our approach is closely related to the [specific framework/architecture], introduced by [Author(s)] [Citations]. The original [framework/architecture name] is designed for [explain original intent or use], and [describe any specific requirements]. A simple variant of our algorithm can be viewed as [discuss your contribution or extension], a point which we revisit in [Section/Part reference].
