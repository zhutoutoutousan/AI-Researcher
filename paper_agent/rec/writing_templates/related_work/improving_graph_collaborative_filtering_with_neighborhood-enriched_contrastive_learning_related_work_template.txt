\section{Related Work}

In this section, we briefly review the related works in two aspects, namely [First Aspect] and [Second Aspect].

\subsection{[First Aspect]}
Different from traditional [First Aspect Techniques], [First Aspect Framework/Method] organizes [data type] into a [structure/type] and learns meaningful [representations/features] from the [structure/type]. Early studies [Citation 1, Citation 2] extract the [structure/information] through [methodology]. Next, [New Method 1] are adopted in [First Aspect] [Citation 3, Citation 4, Citation 5]. For instance, [Module 1] and [Module 2] leverage [strategy/approach] to enhance [outcome/performance]. Besides, some studies [Citation 6] further propose to [describe additional strategies or methods]. Despite the effectiveness, they do not explicitly address [specific challenge or gap]. More recently, [New Approach] is introduced to improve [aspect of research]. For example, [Example Method] devises [methodology] and constructs [objective] to enhance [aspect]. However, most of the existing approaches only focus on [specific issue], neglecting [missing consideration or element].

\subsection{[Second Aspect]}
Since the success of [Second Aspect Technique] in [Field of Application], [Second Aspect] has been widely applied in [Related Fields 1], [Related Fields 2], and [Relevant Application]. As for [Specific Area within Second Aspect], existing studies can be categorized into [Category 1] and [Category 2]. For instance, [Example Method 1] proposes a framework for [Category] and performs [specific operation]. [Example Method 2] transforms [data type] by [methodology], which considers the augmentations in both [Feature Space] and [Structure Space]. Besides, inspired by [Pioneer Study], several methods [Citation 7, Citation 8] have been proposed to [describe the approach]. Related to our work, several studies also apply [Second Aspect Technique] to [Application Area], such as [Example Method 3]. However, existing methods construct [specific data pair] by [current method], and do not fully consider [aspect being neglected] in the [application scenario]. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model [missing relational aspect] via [proposed method or framework].
