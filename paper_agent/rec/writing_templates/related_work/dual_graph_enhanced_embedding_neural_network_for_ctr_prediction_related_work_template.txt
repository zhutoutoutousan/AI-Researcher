\section{RELATED WORK}

We briefly review three kinds of existing methods that are relevant to our work: 1) [specific method category 1], 2) [specific method category 2], and 3) [specific method category 3].

\subsection{[Specific Method Category 1]}
Using [describe raw input or initial method] can hardly lead to a good result, thus [specific approach/method name] plays a core role and has been extensively studied in the literature [citation]. [Method name] utilizes [description of technique or model] to [describe key feature or benefit]. Owing to its [describe unique advantage], many extensions of [method name] have been proposed [citations]. Recently, [new method/technology] has achieved great success with its [describe strength or application]. It is promising to exploit [new method] for [specific application]. [Related method 1] enhances [base method] with [describe integration] to [describe improvement]. [Related method 2] further [describe additional approach used]. [Related method 3] introduces an interesting [describe methodology] that contains [describe components] to learn [describe learning goal]. [Related method 4] applies [describe method] explicitly. 

\subsection{[Specific Method Category 2]}
Besides [previously discussed technique], [another relevant factor] is also very important. Many works are proposed recently that focus on [describe the focus area]. [Method 1] supposes that [describe assumption] and then uses [describe system or method] for [describe purpose]. [Method 2] observes that [describe observation], thus it utilizes [describe techniques] to [describe objective]. [Method 3] argues that [describe argument], so it employs [describe methodology] to model [describe focus]. [Method 4] learns [describe what is learned] by using [describe technique]. Despite great success has been made by these two kinds of [specific area methods], they cannot effectively solve the [specific challenges]. We are going to solve them in this paper by [describe your novel approach or contribution].

\subsection{[Specific Method Category 3]}
[New method/concept] is widely used in [specific application area] in recent years. [Method 1] models [describe specific interactions or processes] via [describe technique] on the [specific structure] [citation]. [Method 2] utilizes [input data description] to construct [specific model/structure] to [describe objective]. [Method 3] treats the [specific task] as [describe alternative perspective] and employs [describe adaptation] to learn [specific representations]. To better capture [describe what is captured], many other [related methods] have been proposed [citations]. To make full use of [additional information sources], [Method 4] constructs [describe new structure] and then applies [describe technique] to [describe expected outcome]. [Method 5] utilizes [new technique] to [describe method and purpose]. Although these [new technique] based models have made progress, [specific challenge or limitation] is still challenging, as depicted in [referring section].
