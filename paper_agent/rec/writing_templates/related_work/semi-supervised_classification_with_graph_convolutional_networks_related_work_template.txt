\section{Related Work}

Our model draws inspiration from [related field or technique], as well as noteworthy developments in [specific domain]. In what follows, we will provide a brief overview of the related work in both areas.

\subsection{[First Topic of Related Work]}

A substantial number of approaches for [specific problem or challenge] have been proposed in recent years, which can generally be categorized into two major groups: [category 1] and [category 2]. Prominent examples include [example 1], [example 2], and [example 3].

Recently, attention has shifted towards [new trend or approach], exemplified by [specific method or technique] that [brief description of the method]. [Additional examples of the trend/method with comparisons of their approaches]. However, one challenge remains that [describe the challenge that exists].

\subsection{[Second Topic of Related Work]}

[Topic] has previously been explored by [relevant researchers or works], presenting [description of their approach]. This framework [explanation of the method or limitation], which was later addressed by [another research work] through [introduction of a new method or practice]. Additionally, [further advancements in the field by other researchers] introduced [specific techniques or frameworks] which have [describe benefits or limitations].

A related methodology for addressing [specific challenge] was recently proposed by [researchers], who reported [complexity or limitation], thus constraining applications in [context]. In another relevant approach, [other researchers] transformed [specific structures] to [application], necessitating [describe any required preprocessing].

Our proposed method is grounded in [foundational theory or technique], originally developed by [research source]. In contrast to previous works, we focus on [task or problem area] in [context or situation]. We demonstrate that, in this context, several simplifications can be implemented (see Section [number]) that enhance both [aspect 1] and [aspect 2] in [specific scenario].
