The most popular approach to [specific problem] is [existing technique or model] [citation]. Traditionally, [describe traditional method or concept] but in recent work [citation], [discuss recent advances or changes]. Recently, [another popular method] has gained traction in [context]. In earlier studies [citation], [describe key development or technique]. However, [discuss potential limitations or issues with early techniques]. Therefore, [mention any regularization or improvement methods proposed]. 

For [objective or application], [author(s) and citation] propose [describe their method or approach]. This method aims to [explain the goal of the approach]. Furthermore, [discuss another related approach or method, including authors and citation]. [Explain how this approach differs from or builds upon previous work]. 

Despite the advancements mentioned above, [address a gap in the existing research, if applicable]. Our work derives [a new criterion or model] aimed at addressing [specific challenge]. We will demonstrate how [existing techniques or models] can be optimized with respect to this criterion to achieve [expected outcome or improvement].

A detailed discussion of the relationship between our approach and [related approaches] can be found in Section [number]. In Section [number], we further explore [another aspect or comparison related to your work].

This paper primarily focuses on [scope of the work, e.g., offline learning]. Extending these methods to [different scenarios or conditions, e.g., online learning] has been studied for [related tasks] [citation]. 

There is also relevant research on [another aspect of the problem], including [describe a specific direction or technique] [citations]. [Discuss how those models differ from yours]. In contrast, our models are [describe the collaborative aspect or personalization aspect]. We empirically demonstrate that [describe the findings or conclusions related to your work compared to other methods].
