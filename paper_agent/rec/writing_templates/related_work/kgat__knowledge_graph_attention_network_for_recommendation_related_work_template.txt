\section{Related Work}

Several recent efforts have attempted to leverage [specific structure/technique] for [specific application], which can be roughly categorized into two types: [Category 1] and [Category 2]:

\subsection{[Category 1]}
- [Multiple sentences explaining the key characteristics of Category 1 methods, including advantages and limitations of these approaches. Mention specific papers when relevant.]
- \begin{itemize}
    \item [Discuss the first major method in this category, including details about the approach and its limitations.]
    \item [Discuss the second major method in this category, highlighting specific techniques and challenges faced.]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{[Category 2]}
- [Multiple sentences detailing the nature of Category 2 methods, incorporating insights into their operation and drawbacks.]
- \begin{itemize}
    \item [Introduce the first prominent method in this category and elaborate on its mechanisms and shortcomings.]
    \item [Introduce the second prominent method in this category, discussing how it functions and its limitations.]
\end{itemize}

Considering the limitations of existing solutions, we believe it is of critical importance to develop a model that can [describe the intended improvements or innovations]. Towards this end, we take inspiration from [previous work/technique related to the improvement], which offers the potential to achieve [specific goal] but has not been sufficiently explored in [context/application]. Specifically, we propose a new method named [Module Name], which is equipped with [describe the innovations/techniques that address the challenges]. 

Our [Module Name] is conceptually advantageous compared with existing methods in that: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [First comparative advantage over Category 1 methods.]
    \item [Second comparative advantage over Category 2 methods.]
\end{itemize}

The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [First contribution highlighting a key aspect of the work.]
    \item [Second contribution detailing an important feature or development.]
    \item [Third contribution emphasizing the empirical results or performance metrics.]
\end{itemize}
