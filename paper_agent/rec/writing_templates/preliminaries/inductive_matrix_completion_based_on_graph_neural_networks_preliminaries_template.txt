\section{Introduction}

We now present our [framework/method name]. Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Motivation and Intuition}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

\subsection{Detailed Workflow}

[A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Approaches}

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]

\subsection{Key Components}

\subsubsection{[Component 1 Name]}

[Several sentences detailing the functionality and significance of component 1]

\subsubsection{[Component 2 Name]}

[Several sentences detailing the functionality and significance of component 2]

\subsubsection{[Component 3 Name]}

[Several sentences detailing the functionality and significance of component 3]

\subsection{Model Training}

\subsubsection{Loss Function}

We minimize the [loss description] between the predictions and the ground truth:

\begin{equation}
    L = [Loss function formulation]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{[Regularization/Optimization Method Name]}

We propose a [Regularization/Optimization Method] technique that [explain the significance and purpose of the technique]. The formulation is as follows:

\begin{equation}
    L_{[Regularization]} = [Mathematical formulation]
\end{equation}

The final loss function can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    L_{final} = L + \lambda L_{[Regularization]}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ trades off the importance of the [first term] and the [second term].
