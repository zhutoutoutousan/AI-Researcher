\section{METHODOLOGY}

In this section, we describe our proposed [Module Name] framework in detail. [Module Name] is a [brief description of the framework], as illustrated in Fig. [Figure Number]. Complementary to [Previous Work/Technique] (the upper half of the figure), [Additional Methodology or Component] (the lower half of the figure) empowers [the framework/task] with [description of the benefit or analysis] for learning effective [objectives].

\subsection{[Subsection Title 1]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

[Paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module.]

Formally, we define [Concept 1] as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical Expression]
\end{equation}

where [explanations of each term in the equations].

The final [output type] is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical Expression]
\end{equation}

\subsection{[Subsection Title 2]}

To empower [task/application] with [specific aspect], we equip our [Module Name] with [Technique or Approach]. Specifically, we first [describe the action taken], leading to [outcome].  

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical Expression]
\end{equation}

The [advantage] of [Technique/Approach] is as follows:

1. [First advantage description]
2. [Second advantage description]  

Given the [output], we perform [process] in each layer:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical Expression]
\end{equation}

However, [discuss the limitations or challenges in the current approach]. Therefore, we adopt [New Technique/Method], whose key idea is [describe key idea or method]. 

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical Expression]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of variables or parameters].

Thus, we update the [process] rules as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical Expression]
\end{equation}

where [description of resulting variables]. Note that [discuss any considerations about computing or storage requirements].

\subsection{[Subsection Title 3]}

[Discuss the existing methods and their shortcomings, using several sentences for comparison.]

In our proposed method, we address [specific issue(s) with existing methods]. Therefore, we structure the [process] for [task] as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical Expression]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of variables or parameters]. To prevent [specific issue], we implement [specific technique or method].

The overall loss function is defined as:

\begin{equation}
L = [loss expression]
\end{equation}

where [explanations of each term in the loss function].
