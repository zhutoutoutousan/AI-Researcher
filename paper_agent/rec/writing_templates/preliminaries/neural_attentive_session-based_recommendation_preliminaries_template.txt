\section{METHOD}

In this section, we first introduce the [task name]. Then we describe the proposed [module name] in detail.

\subsection{[Task Name]}

[Provide a brief introduction to the task and its significance. Explain the context and motivation behind studying this task.]

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical representation]
\end{equation}

\subsection{Overview}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. The basic idea of [module name] is to [explain the core concept]. As shown in Figure [number], [description of the workflow with involved components].

Specifically, we [explain the primary function or operation of key components]. Furthermore, the role of [specific element] is to [describe its function and its importance in the context]. It should be noted that [any additional nuanced detail about the component, if necessary]. 

The basic idea of our work is to [summarize the central goal of the work]. In the following parts of this section, we first describe [sub-component 1] in [module name] which is used to [explain its purpose]. Then we introduce [sub-component 2] which is used to [explain its purpose]. Finally, we show our [module name] which combines both and computes [describe the output].

\subsection{[Sub-component 1 Name]}

In [sub-component 1], the inputs are [describe the inputs] while the output is [describe the output]. Both the inputs and outputs are represented by [explain the representation, e.g., high-dimensional vectors].

As illustrated in Figure [number], we use [specific components or techniques] as the basis for [sub-component 1] because [reason for choice]. [Explain the core operations and any relevant mathematical formulations].

Nevertheless, [discuss any drawbacks or challenges associated with this approach].

\subsection{[Sub-component 2 Name]}

The architecture of [sub-component 2] is similar to [sub-component 1] as shown in Figure [number]. In this scheme, we also use [explain the common components and their functions]. To capture [specific aspect], we involve [describe any specific mechanisms employed].

[Describe mathematical formulations related to this component].

This approach allows [describe the advantages and importance of this sub-component].

\subsection{[Overall Module Name]}

For the task of [task name], [sub-component 1] provides [describe functionality], while [sub-component 2] [describe its functionality]. We conjecture that [explain the relationship between components and how they enhance the process]. 

As shown in Figure [number], the representations are combined to form [describe the resulting structure]. It should be noticed that [explain how components work together and their individual roles].

To learn the parameters of [module name], we do not utilize [mention any previous or standard procedures that are not used]. Instead, we propose [explain any new methods or approaches adopted].

Our model can be trained by [explain the training methodology]. The loss function is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
    L (p, q) = - \sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i \log(q_i)
\end{equation}

where [briefly explain the variables]. Finally, [explain the training process and techniques such as Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT)].
