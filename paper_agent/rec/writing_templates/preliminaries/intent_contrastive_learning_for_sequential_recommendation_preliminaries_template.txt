\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
Assume that a system has a set of [define set or variables, e.g., users, items] denoted by [notation]. Each entity [entity] has [describe the relevant characteristic or data structure, e.g., sequences of actions] represented as [notation]. We denote [concept] as [notation], where [describe the attributes or dimensions involved]. In practice, [brief explanation of practical considerations, e.g., sequence length management]. The goal of the [task] is to [state the main objective or prediction] among the set [notation], given [relevant input data notation].

\subsection{Method Overview}
To tackle [challenge], our method consists of [number] main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Specifically, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [mathematical formulation]
\end{equation}

\noindent where [explanation of terms used in the equation]. [Provide transition phrases to connect with the next subsection or paragraph.]
