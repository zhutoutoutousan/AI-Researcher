\section{Preliminaries and Related Work}

\subsection{Graph Notation and Definitions}

Considering a graph \( G = \langle V, A \rangle \), where \( V \) is the set of nodes and \( A \) is the adjacency matrix, we define \( a_{ij} \) as the edge between node \( i \) and node \( j \). If there is a directed edge from node \( i \) to node \( j \), then \( a_{ij} = 1 \), otherwise, \( a_{ij} = 0 \). 

For ease of notation, we denote the neighbor set of node \( i \) as follows:
\[
S_i = \{ j \mid a_{ij} = 1 \}
\]

Furthermore, we define the normalized adjacency matrix with added self-loops as:
\[
S = \tilde{D}^{-0.5} \tilde{A} \tilde{D}^{-0.5}
\]
where \( \tilde{A} = A + I \) is the adjacency matrix of the graph with added self-connections, and \( I \) is the identity matrix. \( \tilde{D} \) is the degree matrix of \( \tilde{A} \).
