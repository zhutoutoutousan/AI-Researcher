\section{Task Formulation}

\subsection{Introduction}
Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. In this section, we introduce the concept of [key concept] and highlight [key aspects].

\subsection{[Relevant Graph Structure]}
In a [context], we typically have [description of data]. Here we represent [data type] as a [graph name], which is defined as [formal definition]. 

\subsubsection{[First Graph Component]}
Formally, we define [first graph concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
[Mathematical representation]
\end{equation}
where [explanation of terms].

\subsubsection{[Second Graph Component]}
We now introduce [second graph concept], which consists of [description]. It can be represented as [formal definition]. Here, we also establish a set of [alignment set] defined as [formal definition].

\subsection{Unified Graph Concept}
Here we define the concept of [unified graph concept], which encodes [key elements] as a unified relational graph. We first represent [key representation] as [formal representation]. Then, based on [alignment set], we seamlessly integrate [graph components] into a unified graph \( G = \{ ( h, r, t ) | h, t \in [new entity set], r \in [new relation set] \} \).

\subsection{Task Description}
We now formulate the [specific task] to be addressed in this paper:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input:} [description of input data]
    \item \textbf{Output:} [description of the predicted outcome]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{[Key Concept of Connectivity]}
Exploiting [key concept] is crucial to [ultimate goal]. Formally, we define [connectivity definition] as a [type of relation]. Specifically, [multiple sentences explaining the relevance of connectivity in context]. 

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Approaches}
Furthermore, [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]. This highlights that [specific gaps or limitations of the existing methods]. We therefore argue that [proposition regarding the completeness of the proposed method].

\subsection{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we demonstrate that [restated main findings]. Our contributions pave the way for [future directions or implications].
