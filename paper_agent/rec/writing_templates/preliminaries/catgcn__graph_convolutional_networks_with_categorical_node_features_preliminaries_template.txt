\section{Methodology}

We describe our method under the setting of [specific task or application], whereas the idea is generally applicable to [list other relevant applications]. The structure is represented as [brief description of representation, e.g., a matrix] where [define variables and parameters]. The main consideration of our work is that [specific challenge or problem]. For [specific concept], we denote [definition or notation].

\subsection{Overall Framework}

The target of [Module Name] is to [specific goal, e.g., improve representations] by [describe the approach]. As illustrated in [reference to a figure/table], [provide detailed explanation of the framework]. In particular, [description of the first component], [description of the second component], [description of any other components].

Specifically, our approach can be formally defined as:

\begin{equation}
Y = [mathematical representation],
\end{equation}

where [explain each term in the equation, e.g., variables, dimensions]. Along the development of [related operations], we implement [specific design choice/implementation detail].

Similar to [related approaches], [Module Name] is learned in an [describe learning approach, e.g., end-to-end] manner by optimizing an objective function:

\begin{equation}
L = [objective function],
\end{equation}

where [define variables in the objective function]. In the following, we introduce the [subsequent components or processes].

\subsection{[Component/Subsection Title]}

Inspired by [previous work or theory], [Module Name] focuses on [explain the focus]. To thoroughly address [specific aspect], our first belief is that [motivation for the approach]. Here, we consider [specific elements or modules].

To bridge [specific gap], [Module Name] integrates [list of interactions or modules] into [specific representation or outcome]. Specifically, as shown in [reference to a figure/table], [Module Name] consists of three main modules:

- · [First Module]: [Description of the purpose and process].
- · [Second Module]: [Description of the purpose and process].
- · [Third Module]: [Description of the purpose and process].

\subsubsection{[Submodule Title]}

For [specific concept], [describe the process or methodology]. For example, [provide an illustrative example]. The interactions are typically formulated as [mathematical representation or operation], which yields [outcome/impact]. 

\begin{equation}
h_{\text{local}} = [mathematical representation],
\end{equation}

where [explain the parameters and terms involved].

\subsubsection{[Another Submodule Title]}

Distinct from [previous section], the purpose of [Module Name] is to [describe]. In [real-world scenarios/experiments], [explain the diversity or importance]. Therefore, we need [describe the necessity]. Inspired by [theory or methodology], we achieve [specific goal or processing] with [approach or technique].

We represent [concept or representation] as [mathematical or diagrammatic representation]. Formally, we define:

\begin{equation}
[mathematical representation],
\end{equation}

where [define terms involved]. 

\subsubsection{[Final Submodule Title]}

To comprehensively utilize the strengths of [previous components], [Module Name] fuses [relevant components] into [final representation]. As such, we perform [specific methodology], resulting in:

\begin{equation}
h' = [mathematical representation],
\end{equation}

where [define parameters and their significance].

Overall, [explain the outcome and implications].
