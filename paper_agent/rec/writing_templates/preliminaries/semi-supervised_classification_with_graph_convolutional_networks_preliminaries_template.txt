\section{[Section Title]}

In this section, we provide theoretical motivation for a specific [model/type of method] that we will use in the rest of this paper. We consider a [description of the model or method] with the following [defining characteristic or equation]:

\begin{equation}
H^{(l+1)} = [insert equation or propagation rule here]
\end{equation}

Here, [describe any relevant components or variables in the equation]. In the following, we show that [explain the theoretical basis or implications of the defined model/method].

\subsection{[Subsection Title]}

We consider [description of the specific aspect of the model/method] defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
g_{\theta} \star x = [insert relevant equation]
\end{equation}

where [explain the components of the equation]. The evaluation of [describe computation] is [describe complexity or challenges]. To circumvent this problem, it was suggested that [discuss existing methods/approaches that address the challenge].

Going back to our definition, we now have:

\begin{equation}
g_{\theta}' \star x \approx [insert corresponding equation]
\end{equation}

with [explain any new definitions or adjustments made]. Note that this expression is now [describe the properties of the expression]. 

\subsection{[Next Subsection Title]}

A [description of the model/method] can therefore be built by [explain the construction process, using relevant terms]. Now, imagine we limited [describe the limitations or focus for the discussion].

In this way, we can still recover a rich class of [filter functions or models] by [describe what happens when this model/method is applied]. [Provide additional insight into the practical implications or expected results of this model/method].

Furthermore, under these approximations, [restate or simplify previous equations as needed]. The filter parameters can be [discuss parameter sharing or constraints around parameters]. 

Additionally, it can be beneficial to [describe best practices, e.g., constraints, simplification techniques]. This leaves us with the following expression:

\begin{equation}
g_{\theta} \star x \approx [insert simplified expression here]
\end{equation}

Note that [discuss any significant observations or properties]. To mitigate any potential issues, we introduce [explain any adjustments or new techniques].

We can generalize this definition to [insert generalization description] as follows:

\begin{equation}
Z = [insert general expression here]
\end{equation}

where [describe the components of the generalized expression]. This operation has complexity [discuss computational complexity or efficiency].
