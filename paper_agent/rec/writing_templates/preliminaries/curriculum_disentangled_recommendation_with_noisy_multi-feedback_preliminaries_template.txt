\section{Method}  
In this section, we introduce the proposed [Model Name] to [describe the primary goal or objective of the model]. 

\subsection{Notations and Problem Formulation}  
\textbf{Notations} We denote [Notation 1] as [description of Notation 1], where [provide necessary context or definitions for the notation]. [Further definitions and notations can be introduced here, modeled similarly.]

\textbf{Problem Formulation} The [specific aspect of users' interactions] contains [describe various types of user interactions or data] represented as [list the sequences with brief explanations]. Our goal is to [state the main goal related to user intentions or interactions, for example, "learn the intents of users" or "accurately predict user preferences"]. Additionally, we utilize [mention any auxiliary information, e.g., user profiles or additional data points] to enhance [describe the aim of using this information, e.g., "the learning and prediction process"].

\textbf{Components of the Method} To tackle [specific challenge or problem], our method consists of three main components:  
1. [Component 1: Brief description]  
2. [Component 2: Brief description]  
3. [Component 3: Brief description]  

\textbf{Mathematical Formulation} Formally, we define [Concept] as follows:  
\begin{equation}  
    [Mathematical expression or equation representing the key concept]  
\end{equation}  
\[ \text{Detailed explanation of the terms used in the equation.} \]  

\textbf{Workflow Description} [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the model or method, including how various components interact.]  

\textbf{Comparison with Existing Approaches} [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches, highlighting improvements or differences.]  

\subsection{Key Insights}  
[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method, including any relevant background or contextual information.]  

[Logical flow between components should be maintained throughout the methods section.]
