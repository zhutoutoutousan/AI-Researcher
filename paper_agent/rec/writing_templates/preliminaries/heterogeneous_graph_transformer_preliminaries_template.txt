\section{Preliminaries and Related Work}

In this section, we introduce the basic definition of [key concept] and review the recent developments on [domain/technique] and their [specific variants]. We also highlight the differences between [new method] and existing approaches in [related domain].

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Key Concept/Domain]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

Formally, we define [key concept] as follows:

\begin{definition}
    [Definition Number]. [Key Concept]: [Formal definition of the concept].
\end{definition}

[Additional terms and definitions related to the key concept, if necessary.]

[Short paragraph explaining the significance of the key concept in real-world applications.]

Furthermore, [a brief overview of existing research related to the key concept, highlighting gaps or limitations].

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Framework/Architecture]}

Recent years have witnessed the success of [framework/architecture] for [application domain]. Generally, [framework/architecture] can be regarded as [description of how it utilizes input data].

Formally, it has the following form:

\begin{definition}
    [Definition Number]. General [Framework/Architecture] Framework: Suppose [notation] represents [meaning], the update procedure is as follows:
    
    \[
        [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
    \]
\end{definition}

[A brief explanation of the main components and their functions in the framework/architecture.]

Various [related architectures or methods] have been proposed following this framework. [List and briefly explain several existing architectures and their contributions.]

\subsection{[Subsection Title: Proposed Method/Extension]}

Recently, studies have attempted to extend [existing framework/architecture] for [specific applications]. [Summary of related attempts and their implications.]

Though these methods have shown [brief summary of achievements], they [highlight limitations or shortcomings]. To address this, we propose [new method] that [describe the novel approach].

To summarize, the key differences between [new method] and existing attempts include:

- (1) [Specific difference #1 and its significance].
- (2) [Specific difference #2 and its significance].
- (3) [Specific difference #3 and its significance].
- (4) [Specific difference #4 and its significance].
