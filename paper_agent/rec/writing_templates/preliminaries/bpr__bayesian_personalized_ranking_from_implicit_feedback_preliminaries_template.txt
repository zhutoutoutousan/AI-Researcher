\section{Preliminaries}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. 

Furthermore, we provide motivation for our approach outlined through the following points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]
    \item [Additional sentence or two emphasizing the significance of the proposed method]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detailed Workflow of the Module}
The workflow of our proposed method is outlined as follows:
