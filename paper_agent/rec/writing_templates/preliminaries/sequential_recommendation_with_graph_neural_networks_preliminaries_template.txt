\section{Problem Formulation}

Here we provide a formal definition of [main topic]. Assume we have a set of [entities], denoted by [set notation], where [element notation] denotes an [entity type]. The number of entities is denoted as [|set notation|]. Generally, a [subject] has a [interaction type] with entities: $\{ [element notation]_1, [element notation]_2, \ldots, [element notation]_{n} \} $, where $n$ is the number of interactions and [element notation]$_{i}$ is the $i$-th [entity type] that the [subject] has interacted with. The goal of [main topic] aims to [describe the objective]. The [subject]â€™s characteristics can be inferred from [type of feedback/interaction]. Based on the above definition, the task of [main topic] can be formulated as follows:

\textbf{Input:} The [describe input type] for each [subject type] $\{ [element notation]_1, [element notation]_2, \ldots, [element notation]_{n} \} $.

\textbf{Output:} A [type of model] that [describe output type and its estimation goal].
