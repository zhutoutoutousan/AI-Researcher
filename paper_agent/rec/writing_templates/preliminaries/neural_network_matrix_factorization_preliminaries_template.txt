\section{MODEL}

Let \[ N \] = \{ 1, 2, \ldots, N \}. A data array is modeled as a collection of real-valued random variables \( X_{n,m} \), for \( (n, m) \in J \), where \( J \subset [N] \times [M] \) are the indices of the observed entries of the \( N \times M \) data array. \textbf{[Explain the generalization to higher-dimensional arrays or different types of data, including a concise rationale.]}

To each row, \( n \in N \), we associate a latent feature vector \( U_n \in \mathbb{R}^D \) and a latent feature matrix \( U'_n \in \mathbb{R}^{D'} \times \mathbb{R}^{K} \). Similarly, to each column, \( m \in M \), we associate a latent feature vector \( V_m \in \mathbb{R}^D \) and a latent feature matrix \( V'_m \in \mathbb{R}^{D'} \times \mathbb{R}^{K} \). \textbf{[Define any indexes or terms that will be used in the following sections.]}

Let \( f_{\theta} \) represent a model (e.g., neural network, regression model) with parameters \( \theta \). \textbf{[Describe the general use of parameters in relation to the random variables being modeled.]}

Viewing \( \theta \) and the latent features \( (U, V) \) as unknown parameters, we assume the entries \( X_{n,m} \) are independent random variables with means 

\[
\hat{X}_{n,m} := \hat{X}(U_n, V_m, U'_n, V'_m).
