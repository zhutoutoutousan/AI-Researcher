\section{Preliminaries}

We first introduce [model/technique] to address [challenge]. We then perform [type of studies, e.g., ablation studies] on [model/technique] to evaluate [objective]. The novel contribution of this section is to demonstrate that [key finding].

\subsection{Overview of [Model/Technique]}

In the initial step, [describe the basic structure or input of the model/technique]. Let [variable notation] denote [description of key variables]. Then, [model/technique] leverages [describe method or graph structure] to perform [describe what the model does]:

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of each term in the equations]. By [describe the process, e.g., propagating layers], [model/technique] obtains [description of embeddings and outputs]. 

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

Furthermore, we argue that [key critique or alternative perspective]. [Provide reasoning for this argument]. In the next subsection, we provide empirical evidence to support this argument.

\subsection{Empirical Explorations on [Model/Technique]}

We conduct [type of studies, e.g., ablation studies] on [model/technique] to explore the effect of [specific components or hyperparameters]. We use [details about experimental setup, e.g., codes, datasets] to ensure [describe fairness of comparison]. Thus, we change [describe methodological change] to obtain [justification for methodological choices].

We implement [number] variants of [model/technique]:

- [Variant 1 description]
- [Variant 2 description]
- [Variant 3 description]

For these variants, we keep [explanation of parameters/settings]. We report the results of [describe setting] in Table [number].

As can be seen, [analysis of findings, comparing results]. From these observations, we conclude [list of findings]:

1. [Finding 1]
2. [Finding 2]
3. [Finding 3]

To gain more insights into [subject of analysis], we [description of additional analysis methods]. As can be seen, [analysis of training results or performance].

From these evidences, we can draw the conclusion that [key conclusion about the findings]. Theoretically speaking, [explain theoretical perspective]. However, [contrast practical findings]. To round out this section, we claim that when designing [type of model/technique] for [application], it is important to [advice regarding rigorous studies or model design considerations]. Otherwise, [outline potential negative implications].
