\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\textbf{Datasets and Evaluation Metrics.} We evaluate our method on [number] representative [task] datasets: [Dataset 1], [Dataset 2], and [Dataset 3]. [Dataset 1] contains [description of Dataset 1, including size and categories]. Following [previous work A], we use [specific number of videos] for training and [specific number of videos] for testing. [Dataset 2] is also a large-scale dataset that contains [size and other relevant characteristics]. [Dataset 3] contains [size and relevant characteristics]. Following official instructions, we report [evaluation metric] on all three datasets.

\textbf{Implementation Details.} We use [Model/Method Name] for experiments throughout the paper unless otherwise specified. For pretraining, we train the model for [number] epochs on [Dataset] with a batch size of [batch size]. We also use [learner name/optimizer] with [learning rate strategy] for both pretraining and finetuning. The pretraining process takes about [time] on [number] [hardware type].

\subsection{Main Results}

\textbf{Effectiveness of [Method Name].} To demonstrate the effectiveness of [Method Name], we compare it with [number] baselines: (1) [Baseline 1 description]; (2) [Baseline 2 description]; (3) [Baseline 3 description]; (4) [Baseline 4 description]. The comparison results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:comparison}. We observe that: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Observation 1]
    \item [Observation 2]
    \item [Observation 3]
    \item [Observation 4]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Deeper Dataset Analysis.} To further understand the performance variations of [Method Name] among [list datasets], we perform a [description of analysis]. Specifically, we use the following strategies: (1) [Strategy 1 description]; (2) [Strategy 2 description]. The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:temporal}. We conclude that: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Conclusion 1]
    \item [Conclusion 2]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comparisons with State-of-the-Art Methods.} We compare [Method Name] with state-of-the-art methods on [specific datasets]. On [Dataset 1, Dataset 2], we see from Table \ref{tab:sota} that our approach achieves [describe performance improvement]. On [Dataset 3], we see from Table \ref{tab:sota3} that [describe performance].

\subsection{Ablation Study}

Below, we provide a set of ablation studies to justify the contribution of different components in our framework.

\textbf{Importance of [Component/Method].} In our study, we first conduct [description of ablation study] to show [component importance]. We provide results in Table \ref{tab:ablation}. We have some interesting findings:

    \item [Finding 1]
    \item [Finding 2]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Different Strategies.} We also experiment with [strategy 1] and [strategy 2]. The results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:mask}. We have several observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Observation A]
    \item [Observation B]
    \item [Observation C]
\end{itemize}
