\section{Introduction}

We now introduce our notation. Let $X$ be a [description of the set/space relevant to your work] and let $\Sigma$ denote [definition of sets relevant to your work]. Let $\text{Prob}(X)$ denote [description of the space of probability measures defined on $X$]. We can now define [elementary concept] as follows:

\subsection{Distances and Divergences}
To tackle [specific challenge], we define several key distances and divergences between two distributions $P_r, P_g \in \text{Prob}(X)$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total Variation (TV) distance:}
    \[
    \delta (P_r, P_g) = \sup_{A \in \Sigma} |P_r(A) - P_g(A)|
    \]
    
    \item \textbf{Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence:}
    \[
    KL(P_r \| P_g) = \int \log\left(\frac{P_r(x)}{P_g(x)}\right) P_r(x) d\mu(x)
    \]
    where [description of the assumptions made on the distributions].
    
    \item \textbf{Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence:}
    \[
    JS(P_r, P_g) = KL(P_r \| P_m) + KL(P_g \| P_m)
    \]
    where $P_m$ is [definition of the mixture distribution].
    
    \item \textbf{Earth-Mover (EM) distance or Wasserstein-1:}
    \[
    W(P_r, P_g) = \inf_{\gamma \in \Pi(P_r, P_g)} \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim \gamma} [\|x - y\|]
    \]
    where [description of the joint distribution and its relevance].
\end{itemize}
