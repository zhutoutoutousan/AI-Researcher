\section{Preliminaries}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [component 1]
    \item [component 2]
    \item [component 3]
\end{itemize}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]

\textbf{Motivation:} [Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

\subsection{Detailed Workflow}
[Paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]

\subsection{Comparison with Existing Approaches}
[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches]

\subsection{Explanation of Key Terms}
