\section{Module Name}

Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. Our approach consists of [describe the general components of the method]. 

\subsection{Introduction}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]. Furthermore, [additional context or background on the challenge]. 

\subsection{Methodology}

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Specifically, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
\text{Mathematical formulation of the key concept}
\end{equation}

[A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. The complete set of parameters for the model includes [describe the parameters]. 

The [describe the input/output relations in the method; possibly use multiple equations]:
\begin{equation}
\text{Mathematical formulation for output based on input}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\text{Mathematical formulation for a related component}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Gradient and Learning}

[Several sentences explaining the learning process, including any approximations used]. To this end, we use [describe the learning strategy briefly]. 

As depicted in [refer to figure or diagram], the [describe the role of the gradient or backpropagation]. 

Equation [number] specifies the overall loss function, which is composed of three primary terms:

\begin{equation}
\text{Mathematical formulation for the overall loss}
\end{equation}

where [explain each term in the equation, clarifying their roles in training].

\subsection{Evaluation of the Model}

The log-likelihood of the complete model can be evaluated as follows:

\begin{equation}
\text{Mathematical formulation for log-likelihood}
\end{equation}

while considering [any relevant assumptions]. 

\subsection{Prior Distribution}

We define the prior distribution over [concept] as [define the distribution]. [Explain how this prior is used within the training framework and its significance]. 

[Optional future work or improvements that could be pursued].
