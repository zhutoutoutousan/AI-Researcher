\section{Discussion}

We have presented a complete [method/approach/technique] based on [core principle/innovative technique], and a framework to optimize it end-to-end for [objective/performance metric]. Our [method/approach] offers improvements in [specific performance aspect] over [existing method/comparison methods] for most [application/test data]. More remarkably, although the method was optimized using [initial optimization metric], the results are much more [descriptive qualitative comparison] than those obtained with [comparison methods], which commonly suffer from [drawback]. Consistent with this, [alternative performance metric] exhibits substantial improvement across all [test conditions]. We believe this performance improvement arises because [explanations and motivations behind the proposed method]. Nevertheless, additional improvements might be possible if the method were optimized using [alternative optimization metric].

For comparison to [related methods/approaches], we can interpret our analysis as [analogue comparison]. As in many other [analogous optimized representations], the [components/filters] are [characteristics of the components] and the representation is [description of representation properties]. Whereas most [comparison methods] use [standard techniques or methods], the [properties of our method] may explain the ability of the model to better capture [specific features/aspects].

Our work is related to two previous publications that [describe the connection]. [Reference 1] introduces [brief description of the method]. However, [key differences]. Further, [discuss an additional limitation of this reference]. The model developed by [Reference 2] [describe the model and its strengths], but it is not clear whether [specific limitation or area of improvement].

We are currently testing [alternative approaches] to determine how much of the performance and [specific aspect] of our results is due to [specific features or techniques]. Preliminary results indicate that [initial findings/insights], which suggests that [implications for future research or application]. However, such conclusions are [caution about the findings].

The [objective/framework/approach] can be viewed as a particular instantiation of [broader category], suggesting potential insights for [specific application or field]. For example, [possible broader application]. In any case, our results provide a strong example of the power of [key concept, such as end-to-end optimization] in addressing [specific problem or challenge].
