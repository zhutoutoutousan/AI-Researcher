\section{Abstract}
We demonstrate that [scaling up/increasing complexity of a certain model/approach] greatly improves [specific aspect such as performance, accuracy, etc.], sometimes even becoming competitive with [description of existing state-of-the-art methods]. Specifically, we [describe the main focus of the research, e.g., train/test a model/approach] with [specific attributes, e.g., number of parameters, innovative approaches] and test its performance in the [specific setting, e.g., few-shot, zero-shot, etc.]. For all [mention tasks or categories], [model/approach] is applied without [any unnecessary alterations, updates, etc.], with [mention how tasks are defined or approached] purely via [description of interaction, methodology, etc.]. [Model/approach] achieves strong performance on many [specific datasets or types of tasks], including [examples of tasks]. We also identify some [datasets/tasks] where [model/approach] still struggles, as well as some [datasets/tasks] where [model/approach] faces [description of issues or limitations].
