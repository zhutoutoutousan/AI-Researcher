\section{Discussion}

We have presented a comprehensive [method name] based on [underlying technique], and a framework to optimize it end-to-end for [specific performance metric or objective]. Our [method name] offers improvements in [specific area of comparison, e.g., performance, quality] over [existing methods/approaches] for [specific conditions]. More remarkably, although the method was optimized using [specific optimization criterion], the [output or result type] is [describe quality or attribute compared to others]. Consistent with this, [other evaluation metric or index] exhibits substantial improvement across all [test subjects/conditions]. We believe this improvement arises because [explain the intuition or reason behind the results, connecting to relevant prior work]. Nevertheless, additional improvements might be possible if the method were optimized using [alternative criterion or technique].

For comparison to [related methods/approaches], we can interpret our [core component/analysis] as [describe the interpretation or analogy]. As in many other [relevant techniques or methods] - e.g., [list related methods briefly] - [describe features of these techniques relevant to the discussion]. Whereas most [traditional approaches] use [describe common features of traditional methods], our [method] may explain [reason for effectiveness or advantages in representation].

Our work is related to [number] previous publications that [describe the general area of research these publications cover]. [Citation] introduces an interesting [concept or method], in which [describe key aspects or findings]. However, rather than [describe their focus], their approach is [describe the limitation or difference]. Due to the differences between these approaches (as outlined in Section [x]), their [title of their method or finding] is [describe how it differs from your approach] and may not be optimal. Furthermore, [discuss another limitation or detail regarding a related approach].

The model developed by [another citation] is [describe their focus], making it [characteristics that allow comparison]. Moreover, their formulation has the advantage over ours that [describe their advantage]. However, it remains unclear whether their formulation necessarily leads to [specific outcome or optimality], and [provide a summary of any critical empirical findings or results].
