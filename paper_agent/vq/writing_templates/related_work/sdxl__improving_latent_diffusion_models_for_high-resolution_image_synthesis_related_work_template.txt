Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to address [challenge]. 

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [component 1]
    \item [component 2]
    \item [component 3]
\end{itemize}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:
\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

Furthermore, [A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module].

Specifically, [Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches].

To this end, we have constructed our method in the following manner: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Detailed explanation of each term in the equations]
\end{enumerate} 

Overall, our work builds upon the insights from [related work references] and aims to advance the field by [main contribution of the paper].
