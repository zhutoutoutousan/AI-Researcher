\section{Related Work}

We refer the reader to [Appendix/Section] for a discussion on [specific topic or methodology].

The recent work of [Author(s), Year] has explored the use of [specific technique or methodology] in the context of [application or problem]. Although the initial motivations may seem [different/similar], at the core of it, both our works aim to [briefly describe common goal], which [mechanism or technique] enables.

Furthermore, the work of [Author(s), Year] presents [description of a relevant finding or method]. We believe this direction is quite [important/relevant], and may potentially lead to [briefly mention implications or future research opportunities].

Specifically, we propose [module name] to address [specific challenge]. Our method consists of three main components: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3].

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
[Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

To tackle [challenge], [multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method].

Furthermore, [a paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]. 

To compare our method with existing approaches, we [several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches].

Finally, we provide a detailed explanation of each term in the equations: [detailed explanation of each term with relevant context].
