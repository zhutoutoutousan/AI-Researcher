\section{Approach}

Our goal is to exploit the promising capabilities of [model/type] and introduce them to [application domain/challenge]. Previous work [reference] which applied [technology/technique] to [specific task] demonstrated [results/comparisons], but [challenge/issue] limits its scalability.

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method]

To tackle [challenge], our method consists of three main components: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Component 1]
    \item [Component 2]
    \item [Component 3]
\end{itemize}

This approach, summarized in Fig. [figure number], is able to [main outcome of the approach].

\subsection{[Subheading for a specific component or module]}

To utilize [method/architecture], we need to express [concept/image data] in the form of [format/type]. Instead of [previous method], our approach requires [description of new method]. Formally, we define [key concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
    [Mathematical formulation of the key components]
\end{equation}

[A paragraph describing the detailed workflow of the module]

Backpropagation through the [non-differentiable element/operation] is achieved by [method/approach], allowing [details about training and optimization].

The complete objective for [task/model] can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    [Complete mathematical formulation]
\end{equation}

where [explanation of parameters and terms used in the equations].

[Detailed explanation of each term in the equations]

To push the limits of [aspect related to the method], we propose [new method/model] that [improvement or feature]. This approach contrasts with [previous works or methods], emphasizing [differences].

\subsection{[Subheading for another specific component or module]}

With [previous components or models], we can now [new task or method implication]. More precisely, [new formulation or representation of method].

Thus, [description of new approach or technique for further manipulation of data].

Given [conditions or information], the task is to [explain new synthesis scenario]. 

In practice, we apply [method/technique] to [solve problem or optimize performance], ensuring [expected outcome].

To generate [output], we utilize [method/application] to [explain process]. This ensures [relationship to training or output quality] while considering [specific conditions or limitations].
