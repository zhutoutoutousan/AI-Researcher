\section{Method}

Our goal is to design a new [method/approach/technique] to address [challenge/problem]. Inspired by [previous work/technique], we propose [module name] to enhance [specific aspect].

\subsection{[First Subsection Title]}

[Multiple sentences explaining the motivation and intuition behind the proposed method.]

We follow the [previous methodology/approach] as discussed in [previous section or reference], as illustrated in [Figure/Table reference]. Since our goal is to improve [specific aspect], we employ the same setup as in [reference/model], while leaving potential improvements to [future work/method] for subsequent investigation.

For [specific functionality or process], we propose [brief description of new approach or technique]. We introduce [method/technique] in Section [Section number], and the [workflow/procedure] in Section [Section number]. We then discuss [related concept] in Section [Section number].

\subsubsection{[First Component Title]}

Formally, we define [concept] as follows:

\begin{equation}
\text{[Mathematical formulation of the key components]}
\end{equation}

In our approach, [detailed explanation of each term in the equations]. 

The objective is to [describe the goal or metric to be minimized/maximized]:

\begin{equation}
L = [mathematical expression]
\end{equation}

Concretely, we [explain the input/output of the process], highlighting the key difference between our approach and [reference to existing methods]. 

\subsubsection{[Second Component Title]}

To tackle [challenge/problem], our method consists of [number of main components]: [component 1], [component 2], and [component 3]. Specifically, [detailed workflow of the module or component].

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. \textbf{[Step 1 - Predict]}: [Explanation of the first step in the process].
2. \textbf{[Step 2 - Sample]}: [Explanation of the second step in the process].
3. \textbf{[Step 3 - Schedule]}: [Explanation of the masking schedule or operation].
4. \textbf{[Step 4 - Finalize]}: [Explanation of the finalization step of the process].

The resulting [output or generated item] after [method/process] is [description of the expected outcome].

\subsubsection{[Third Component Title]}

Furthermore, we find that the quality of [specific outcome] is significantly influenced by [specific aspect]. We model [procedure/process] using a function [function name], which is defined as follows:

[Several sentences comparing the proposed method with existing approaches, particularly focusing on the unique blending of techniques that improve performance.]

As we analyze [specific cases or parameters], we will discuss the effect of [aspect] in [Section number]. [Briefly mention how this subsection ties into the larger aim of the methodology.]
