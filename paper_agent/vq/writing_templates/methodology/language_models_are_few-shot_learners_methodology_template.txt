\section{Approach}

Our basic approach is similar to the process described in [\textit{Cite previous work}], with [describe modifications]. Our exploration of [key concept] involves [briefly explain different settings explored]:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Component 1 (e.g., Fine-Tuning)} - [Multiple sentences explaining the description of the component, advantages, and disadvantages. Focus on performance metrics and potential challenges.]
    \item \textbf{Component 2 (e.g., Few-Shot)} - [Multiple sentences explaining the description of the component, advantages, and disadvantages. Include specifics about examples and expected outcomes.]
    \item \textbf{Component 3 (e.g., One-Shot)} - [Explain how it relates to other components with brief comparison.]
    \item \textbf{Component 4 (e.g., Zero-Shot)} - [Explain the component similarly to the above.]
\end{itemize}

The appendix includes [brief description of additional materials included]. We highlight that [summarize key findings related to components].

\subsection{Model and Architectures}

We utilize the same model and architecture as [\textit{Cite previous work}], including [list any modifications]. To study the dependence of [concept] on [factor], we [explain experimental design]. This allows us to [describe experimental focus]. 

More details on [explanation of models/architecture] can be found in the appendix. We [explain how models are partitioned and the reasoning behind it].

\subsection{Training Dataset}

To create our training data, we [describe the process in steps, including any filtering or deduplication methods used]. These include [list of additional data sources or details concerning the dataset used]. 

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{[Table title]}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Setting} & \textbf{Metric 1} & \textbf{Metric 2} & \textbf{Metric 3} & \textbf{Metric 4} \\
        \hline
        \textit{Comparison A} & [value] & [value] & [value] & [value] \\
        \textit{Comparison B} & [value] & [value] & [value] & [value] \\
        % Add more rows as necessary
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Training Process}

We find that [briefly summarize key findings on training processes]. We [explain specific methods employed for training optimization]. Table [number] shows the parameter settings used for [training specifics]. To manage [explain challenges], we employ [describe methods used].

\subsection{Evaluation}

For evaluation, we [explain the methodology for sample selection and evaluation criteria]. For certain tasks, we utilize [mention any additional methods or adjustments]. Similar to [\textit{Cite previous work}], we [describe formatting changes or evaluation strategies used].

Final results are reported on [indicate data source for final results] for [explain the model evaluation scope and conditions].
